2020-07-14 15:52:12,How can I handle the anxiety that job interviews cause me,Work/School,"I understand that job interviews are stressful for most people but they cause me a ridiculous amount of anxiety that at this point is stopping me from applying for jobs.

I have just graduated from university and have a degree which would allow me to work with children which is my dream job...I have only had one interview which was to get into uni,I ended up not passing the interview process and had to take a longer route to get to where I am at this point. The job that I have been in for six years,since I was 15 didn't involve an interview as it's a cafe job.

I guess I just wanted to see if anyone here had any tips because I know that even if I do end up applying for jobs and getting interviews my anxiety is very visible when being interviewed and when I'm aware that it is visible I tend to become worse and worse.",False,4,0,10,0,0,anxiety

For the past year or so, I've had what is either eczema or psoriasis on my scalp, finger, eyelid, and lip. I'm vegan and gluten free, and eat quite well usually. I went to a naturopath today and she said that my high levels of stress are causing me to be unable to properly digest food, resulting in leaky gut and my skin problems. I also have pretty bad anxiety, especially after being sexually assaulted a few years ago.

At work, I overthink and set high standards for myself. I also feel pressure from my family, who expect me to be more successful than they are (even though they are quite well off).

I'm seeing a counsellor soon to address the sexual assault trauma, but is there anything else I can do to relieve stress or cope better? I want to be able to not get so anxious at work and become less self-critical. Has anyone had any success and are able to share their techniques?

I'm struggling with guilt. My son will be without his grandma / great grandma/grandpa who adores him. I'm my mom's only child. All my son's great grandparents on my side, except one (who would be a JustNO anyways) are alive and live back home. I'm due in November with baby #2 (another boy). I have no family here other than in-laws and DH/kid(s).

DH has agreed we can take biweekly or monthly trips, work schedules permitting and everything of course, and visit my mom, family, his mom. I'll get to see them frequently. I just had such a good relationship with my grandparents except one growing up and I'm feeling guilty like I'm robbing my son of that. He'll have his grandpa (FIL) and (step)grandma (FIL wife) so he will have them. He will have a better life and so many more opportunities here and I just keep telling myself that.

2018-11-19 18:43:29,I’ve spent my entire life with a dual diagnosis of ADHD and bipolar disorder.,,"I know it’s common for bipolar people to constantly question their diagnosis, but please bare with me.  

I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was around 10.  Back then, almost no one I knew had that diagnosis.  (Although I’m certain many had it) The school I went to didn’t know what to do with me, but they knew I was a hard worker.  So for the read-a-thon (anyone remember that?) instead of making me read like everyone else, they’d have me make those stupid buttons that everyone got for reading x# of pages.  Every year I was rewarded for my hard work but never made to participate.  

Fast forward to HS.  I was still the “idiot” at school.  So I started smoking a bunch of weed, cutting classes, hanging out w shitty people.  But I always had like 3 jobs and worked really hard, despite being a huge stoner.  

After I was passed through the educational system and got an actual HS diploma, I tried a community college.  Like 5 times.  I dropped out every time because, like I said before, I was just passed through the system so I had no idea what to do in college.  Like, how to study, listen to lectures, take notes...or learn anything.  

Feeling hopeless, I continued to work lame jobs, smoke weed, & hang out w shitty people.  Eventually this lead to me doing harder drugs.  At the time of my bipolar diagnosis, I was about 20 and doing ecstasy everyday.  This alone will make anyone appear to have a severe mental illness.  I could no longer hold a job, ended up in a psychiatric hospital, lost my living arrangement, and had to move back in with my parents.  I was put on handfuls of psychiatric medications and continued to not work.  I lost something in myself during those 2 years of doing too many drugs. Reflecting back, I honestly feel like the drive I’ve always had to work was there, but I was being told that I was disabled, unreliable, bipolar, mentally ill.... incapable of taking care of myself.  

I’ve managed to pull off a lot of things in the last 21 years.  I went to 2 different trade schools and graduated successfully, although I struggled significantly.  I met a man who puts up w my mismanagement of our house and my very occasional mood swings.  I had a beautiful daughter who I live every moment for.  I work two jobs, one of which is a business I own.  

All of this makes me question the bipolar diagnosis.  I have bouts of depression, and anxiety, but overall I’m completely functioning.  I no longer take medications and my husband and coworkers agree that I seem stable. 

My opinion: My shitty life decisions provided me with a shitty diagnosis that kept me from progressing for a huge chunk of time.  I guess I’m just remorseful.  But it all started w an ADHD diagnosis...which I have no doubts about.  

There needs to be more educational systems designed for us!  To keep us on track.  To avoid shitty life decisions.

The threat of immediate consequences focuses my mind and I figure out how to arrive early for a few weeks or months even. Eventually the threat fades in my mind and without the sense of urgency I drop the ball and start sliding back into being late again.

It's long, sorry. I tried editing it as much as I could but I felt like I needed to explain the context. Tl;dr at bottom.

I posted homemade food on a niche sub and woke up to >1k upvotes, very high upvote ratio, and 20 comments telling me about how I called the food the wrong thing. Most comments were very polite. It was a reasonable thing to tell me, because it was food from a different culture than me, and I had mistakenly assumed that the fundamental ingredient of the dish and the ingredient that I used were the same.

But it was the few snide remarks that got me. How their partner was offended by this, or a grandma cries every time someone calls this \[food name\], or insinuating that I spent no time or thought on it. In reality, it took me 2-3 hours to make, but suddenly I felt like I was on the same level as people who can't cook, have no sense of respect for cultural food, and bastardize it. Later I realized that one commenter had misunderstood part of my post, assuming that I simplified the dish 8x more than I actually did. But even though I realized a small part of it was miscommunication, I still felt like it was my fault for not being clear.

I feel so ignorant, thoughtless, embarrassed, offensive, and just really really frustrated at myself for allowing this to happen. I have problems with disordered eating too, which made it worse. In a rare moment, it was a meal that made me feel almost normal. Instead, I've been consumed with shame ever since I got negative feedback on it.

It's been days, but would I be stupid to delete this post now? Even though its karma and upvote ratio were so high, that just makes it even more visible.

26 year old male.
life of depression and anxiety.
finally diagnosed with ADHD 3 months ago.
medication does seem to help!
currently at 10mg methylphenidate (unretarded) daily.
decided to take break for the holidays after about 4 weeks of continuous intake.

I would take them every day since they really seem to help a lot (albeit I experience some rebound after they wear off) but I am afraid of bulding a tolerance?

felt absolutely miserable, depressed and like dying the day after.
felt bad the 2nd day.
feel a bit better, but still like crap the 3rd day.

1. is it advisable/do you take med-breaks?

2. does one really build a tolerance (so quickly)?

3. may my negative symptoms come from methylphenidate withdrawal?

Thanks and Happy Holidays!

&nbsp;

-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-

&nbsp;
I am a 26 year old male who has struggled through his entire life, suffering from axiety, depression, PTSD and - drum roll - from untreated ADHD.

I have finally been diagnosed at age 26 and aside from all the other stuff that has happend in my life, ADHD explains soooo much!

After 4 years of SSRIs (Celexa) which I am not sure of, wether they did more harm or more good, I had yet another mental breakdown this year, severely suicidal and standing in front of the shambles of a chaotic, pathological, painful and agonizing life.

Finally got diagnosed with untreated ADHD 3 months, got medication and they DO actually help. I really do experience a difference. I can DO THINGS NOW!

I first started with Vyvanse, which was extraordinarily effectice, but had verd nasty sideffects (probably also a very bad depressive episode when I started it).

Then I switched to amphetamine-drops (basically pure amphetamine in liquid form) which seemed to help a lot better, but after 3 weeks of continual use, I didn't feel like they were right for me.

Now currently I have been on the lowest dose of unretarted Methylphenidate (5mg in the morning, 5mg at noon) which I so far really liked!

It does help, but I also (as expected) experience some negative sideffects and an unpleasant rebound after they wear off. Which has not bothered me too much so far, since they get me through the day and I start crashing once I get home and would be exhausted anyway. Benefit: I actually go to bed timely now!

Now here's the thing: I believe I have used Methylphenidate (10mg a day) for about 4 weeks in a row without a break.

Now the holidays have arrived, I have 2 weeks off and I decided to take a little break from my meds.

I had heard that this could be useful to minimize the probability of developing a tolerance?

So I stopped and the very next day I felt like a train hit me. I was SEVERELY depressed, very anxious, almost panicky, had headaches, my neckmuscles hurt bad, I felt somewhat feverish and like I had a really nasty cold. It was not good at all.

The next day I felt horrible too. But aside from the negative symptoms I also procrastinated like a sloth and hated myself to the core.

Now the third day I feel slightly better, but still as if I just came back from standing in the middle of a marital fight for 4 weeks in a row and accidentally hit my dog with my car when I finally got to leave.

Now my question: Can these experiences be related to Methylphenidate withdrawal?


Anyway, I wish you wonderful holidays and a pleasant transition into a new year full of possibilities! (:",1577179719.0,2,0,9,0,0,adhd

I feel hopeless. 
I want to kill myself but I feel very guilty about my family and my husband.

I'm 28 years old, I feel so alone. I feel too much stress and pressure and if I dont feel that, I'm feeling numb and out of my body. It just seems I wasnt made for this world, like the life happening around me is so incompatible that I no longer feel an interest to try, I try to make friends but I cant maintain them. It seems people like to crowd around me to watch me desperately grasp for something real as I ask for help. They never help me though they just watch. Why? I feel so abandoned. 

I have a great life, I'm fortunate in many ways. But I'm frustrated and so tired of feeling this way. I have a wonderful husband who would be crushed, but I just feel over this world.

2019-03-06 10:58:30,ADD & Dextroamphetamine/Dexedrine - effects experience long after dosage,,"Hi everyone! 

I'm wanting to gather some information around the general experience with stimulants, namely Dextroamphetamine/Dexedrine instant release (IR) - dosage, effects and withdrawal symptoms.

I've recently been prescribed this for the treatment of Attention Deficit Disorder to the schedule of 10mg in the morning, 5mg in the afternoon (12:30pm).

**TL;DR - Has anyone experienced feeling better after their stimulant has supposedly worn off, with obvious side effects such as energy, increased focus in effect after - is there a scientific explanation?**  

Although I have done some extensive digging into the general consensus; side effects of a too large/small dose, nutrients & cellular interactions, PH balance & absorption, types of medications, food & appetite etc. I haven't located a scientific explanation on what I feel is the withdrawal symptoms being experienced **first**, then the positive side effects coming **after**. 

So my experience so far has been: 

**No effect**: 5 mg morning and night -  no side effects apart from appetite suppression, dry mouth.

**Moderate effect**: 10mg morning, 5mg night - light dry mouth, no appetite suppression, apathy >30 minutes after dose, apathy and low mood alleviated >4/6 hours after dose. 

**Adverse effect**: 10mg morning, 10mg night - excessive sweating/hot flushes, tunnel vision, dry mouth, apathy, breathing pattern irregularity, mental introversion/isolation. 

&#x200B;

I am happy to remain on the 10mg morning/5mg afternoon - anything more is obviously too much. 

I did read about someone having a similar reaction (low mood, apathy in the first few hours of dosage), but I'm wanting to know what this exact reaction is and how it can be countered/managed - any help would be greatly appreciated!

2020-06-02 01:34:11,Being diagnosed as an adult?,Questions/Advice/Support,"I'm 20 years old, I've never been diagnosed with executive dysfunction but I just *know* something is going on. My whole life, I've been a pretty successful member of society, I go to college and work full time. I think the only reason I've made it as far as I have is due to intellect alone-- because let me tell you I am scatterbrained as shit. 

My whole life, I've always started a bunch of things and never finished them. I am **ALL** over the place. I need to be entertained constantly but it seems that most things I seem to forget about or get bored with quickly. If I am not hyperfocused on something or have a grave interest, getting through it seems impossible. It's so much more than procrastination, I try so hard to work smarter but I can not physically do it. I feel inhibited in a way. 

Anyways, growing up my parents did not believe in ADHD/mental illness/medicating for it. My parents are immigrants that have an old fashioned take on mental illness. They believe extremely disturbed people can be ill in the head, but do not believe in depression or anxiety and what not if you aren't nearly a serial killer. Bottom line, they don't believe their children could ever be mentally ill as they see it. In fact, my father worked for the company that manufactured adderall and would come home years ago and mention how it was a scam and just to make money off of. It was always ""why are you so lazy"" or ""why can't you do this or that"". I will admit in high school I did not try as much as I do now, but I still feel so inhibited.

I noticed also that a lot of doctors have the attitude that if you do not get diagnosed when you are a child they don't know how to deal with it/don't want me as a patient. Many people also tell me ""they would have diagnosed it by now since you're an adult"". Unfortunately testing wasn't an option when I was a child. My mother would not allow or entertain any idea of me potentially being tested for any of that. I was always ""normal"" so what's the need for it was her take. 

I suffered my first psychotic break when I was 15 and ever since then my parents just thought I was acting out, or doing it for attention. So this topic has always been strange for me to even attempt to address. However, I don't have any chronic mental illness, it was just caused by too much stress at that given time according to the doc. 

I have access to any kind of doctor I want, I'm an adult, on a PPO and so parents truthfully don't care what I do with my own health now. Even now, I mention how I feel still and they just don't entertain it. ""Real adults don't talk like that.

2020-07-18 05:48:30,Feeling lost again,,"After 4th of July, I started to gain weight and go into old habits again. Old habits of procrastinating and overeating. The guilt started to pile on quickly and I broke from pressure. 

I made a stupid comment on my friends makeup. I'm usually careful about what I say, but I accidentally let my filter slip. She took the comment personal and I tried to follow up the comment with how beautiful she looked and how amazing she was. I can be quite blunt sometimes. I texted her immediately in private (took place in a group chat). I apologized and she texted back that she was okay. I didn't respond after. I tried doing work around the apartment to distract myself, but her response left me with even more guilt. My thoughts only consumed with her response and anxiety. I self harmed myself for the first time in months. Thoughts of suicide came back again. I finally got the courage to text her another apology. She responded back that she got over it quickly within 10 minutes. She texted me that I'm her friend and a small stupid comment about her makeup wasn't going to end our friendship. That's when I finally broke and told her that I selfharmed myself and felt suicidal. I felt so alone and telling her that made me feel like a huge weight was off my shoulders. We ended our conversation with love yous and lots of support for eachother. 

Even if it was a small mistake, I haven't felt the same after. I still feel guilty. Some people might consider my mistakes as ""silly mistakes"" but to me it felt like I was pushed underwater. I just wanted to vent. Thank you if you read to the end.",False,2,0,0,0,0,depression
2020-07-10 08:19:32,Depression from friends: Empathy Vs Sympathy,,"So... I have this thing where I always do my best to pacify my loved ones during hard times (and even strangers I barely know) when they're drowning emotionally/mentally to the point where they could be borderline self-destructive.

 I always find and justify reasons for them to ""get in the boat,"" so they don't drown... while ""sometimes"" secretly wanting or trying to climb into the water myself. But fortunately enough, I never let these feelings overwhelm me and I eventually climb back in.

 Because of this, I don't think I'm capable of ever truly sympathizing with my loved ones when they walk toward that emotional black hole. But I'm pretty sensitive deep down and I get immensely overwhelmed too (often I might add), so I can at least hear them from a place of empathetic understanding. The people I don't keep in my life are those who ONLY want sympathy. And there are lots of you. If they can at least accept their role in the fuckery that's enough for me to want to help when it's warranted.

I'm currently going through this with my best friend again (basically my brother since 2002) for the 1000th time and some people (even certain mutual friends) are bewildered by my continued support... but I will never stop trying to support or encourage him. And yes, I know he has to save himself in the end, and I won't be dragged down with anyone.

2019-07-06 09:31:35,Family events and me,Discussion,"Hi! So this is my first post on this subreddit and I was hoping for some feedback on an issue that I am having. So first some backstory.

I am 16 and live overseas with my parents and am currently on summer break but working as an intern. I was told by my parents that I had to go to a family event. Which was a 16 hour plane ride and some plus the time zone. (It's my grandmother on my dad's sides 50th wedding anniversary. I don't like her very much but my parents don't understand that.) Said event held around 50 or more people mingling in a tight space. Normally this is fine for me but it made me a bit anxious that they were all people I was supposed to know. Me being me, my anxiety turns into me being negative. I know is extremely unhelpful and I try to help it but sometimes I just can't. 

When we go to the event I continued to be negative and this started to get on my father's nerves (understandably) and he took it out by yelling at me at he venue. It did not help the fact that I was being yelled at in front of family. This made me cry an have to sit out for about a fourth of it. 

After the event I still got yelled at but by that time he started I didn't care so I just cryied while he lectured me. Sometimes I feel like they don't understand that I get overwhelmed at events like this. Or understand that, that was actually me trying. This ended in me having to stay in the same room as my father for a whole five days after he yelled at me. This caused us to continue taking jabs at eachother. This resulted in me saying some extream thing that I would do and saying that I hate my life. At that exact moment I really did.

So fast forward to now. My parents wanted me to go out with them to get groceries. I said I would rather stay home. My father took this (probably) as me challenging him. He talked to me sternly then I politely decline. He then proceeded to yell at me and te me that we would ""talk"" about my attitude when they got back. Unfortunately I can't be without them forever so I can't just run away so I have to face this. But I don't quite know what to say to them when they get home. Hopefully this won't be as bad as I think. But honestly this might be worse.",False,2,0,0,0,0,anxiety
2019-02-16 15:53:24,"Persistent anxiety over work, need advice",Work/School,"I've been having a slightly rough situation recently. Money is tight, I'm worried about some friendships in my life right now, I'm trying to figure out moving home, and I have multiple looming deadlines in college. So I'm not at my best right now, but I'm somewhat staying on top of it, except for that sinking feeling of worry in my gut sometimes, but it passes. 

I got a job (or I'm at least in the stage where they're seeing how I do before they commit to hiring me), which I thought would alleviate my money concerns at least, and make me less anxious. NOPE. My worry is through the roof. I'm so worried about my performance at work because I really want this job to work out, and I don't want to inconvenience or dissapoint the people in charge there. 

I had my first day yesterday. It's a takeout place a short while from my house. Yesterday I messed up quite a few things- I gave someone the wrong change, didn't know multiple times if a meal deal did/ did not include something, and spoke too fast to customers. All under supervision from someone working there. And I know for a fact she noticed every single mistake... 

I'm trying my hardest but I feel like my constant anxiety and worry for that shift messed up a lot of my performance. Everything was my fault that I did wrong. My next shift is in a little over an hour, today. 

Anyone have any tips at all for keeping cool under time pressure and supervision, and has anyone else worked a similar job before and made it go smoothly? I can't get this off my mind to try and relax before going, so I'm studying the menu right now. ",False,2,0,4,0,0,anxiety

I would like to hear your tips on how to improve or get over this condition,Advice Needed,"Hi, so I finally made a research and after almost a year of panic attacks I am very sure I have cardiophobia. I don't have trouble socializing, public speaking and other fears many people have but I do have one which bugs my mind.

As soon as I feel my heart beating too fast or just see a heart rate which is not ""perfect"" on my apple watch, I immediately start to panic. 

This really started taking a toll on my life since I'm afraid I'll die. I find myself constantly checking out the heart rate monitor or watching my abdomen to see how fast my heart is beating.

The funny thing is, I have no trouble cycling at heart rate of 130 or more or running, but if I am resting or doing something ""unsporty"" and my heart rate rises, I immediately go into panic mode.

I made an appointment with psychologist but because of the Covid situation everything is halted. 

I have phases of panic attacks that sometimes occur daily, then it's okay for a month and then they start happening again. Summer is especially hard because hot and humid weather impacts the heart rate - which again launches a panic mode for me.

Does anyone share the same feeling? I would like to know how to cope with that or how to solve this issue.

2019-07-24 04:06:07,I Feel Trapped at Work,Work/School,"A little back story here. I’m a 28 year old male that just got a Bachelors of Science in Aeronautics last December . I was never a good student in high school and only did well enough to pass.I struggle with anxiety and depression and when I started college, I was bound and determined to finish. I started with the idea of wanting to be a pilot but realized that (a) I didn’t want to be away from my wife and (b) I don’t trust myself with my anxiety to fly solo. However, I decided to keep my major in aviation and minor in aviation management. I did really well in college and graduated with honors.

Fast forward to my current job. I’m the manager of small flying club that specializes in flight training. I’ve been there almost two years but I feel like I’m in a rut. Outside of the flight instructors, I’m the only employee. I wear many hats at work from managing students, managing social media, and handle the finances. When I started the job, I was happy to have it, but I don’t feel like my heart is in it anymore. The bank account does not have enough to ever give me a raise (I only make $30k annually), my phone rings 7 days a week, which makes me feel like I am never truly “off” from work, and I have no benefits. My anxiety and depression feed off of this and it makes me feel hopeless.

My bosses are great guys but seem to not always be on the same page. Since they are the owners, they could close shop whenever they wanted. I just feel stuck and honestly I don’t my heart is in aviation like I thought it was. I feel like maybe I was just too determined to finish my degree.

* Says it's not a chemical imbalance and that he just can't help focusing on 'the issue' in his mind.
* Will let me hug him, but right now he's pretty closed off.
* Occurs maybe every month or two, usually during school periods, though again this is the worst I've seen it so far.
* No signs of suicide, so far. But it sure seems like this type of behavior at its worst could lead to it I'm afraid.
* Does go to work thankfully... for now.

Usually the issue seems to goes away after a day or two, sometimes even during the day itself. So far he's on a pretty bad three day streak.

He just got health insurance, so I'm hoping to get him to the doctor to start figuring this out. Any general thoughts on what it might be though would be appreciated.

2020-04-21 17:39:44,Coping with new job anxiety / COVID-19,Work/School,"I'm sure these past few weeks haven't been easy for anyone at this point. I've been managing things well enough...but between starting a new job and the ongoing isolation of COVID-19, it's finally wearing me down.

I started a new job literally two weeks as a manager of a small team before the brunt of COVID-19 hit my state. I had a fair amount of on-boarding, but being my first foray as a manager, I was already a bit charged in terms of my anxiety. Then, we were all ordered to work remotely, so it really felt like being thrown into the deep end of the pool.

Some days are really good. I feel like I'm managing my team to the best of my ability, many are already confiding in me and asking for appropriate guidance and I'm learning more every day. Other days, when I goof something up or don't have a right answer, it sends me into a tailspin. I normally can keep a foot on the ground and remind myself ""you're still new, and the circumstances are what they are. Just keep going.""

But today, I just feel like I'm failing. Today is one of those days where I made some mistakes that really aren't a huge deal, but I'm taking them super seriously. 

FWIW, my boss and mentor has assured me I'm doing great, so maybe I'm stressing for nothing. Part of me wants to be 110 percent knowledged in every team member's job, which maybe isn't the right strategy for now.

2020-07-18 19:09:28,Boyfriend with depression during covid... how can I help?,,"After feeling weirdly disconnected for the past few weeks, I finally broached the subject with my boyfriend and asked him how he has been feeling because I could tell something was off. He admitted he's ""not happy"" right now, that he's ""struggling"" but didn't really go into it much further - he's British, doesn't really open up too much about his emotions on the regular, and even went as far as to say that talking about these things doesn't help him at all, it doesn't make him feel better, he'd rather work things out on his own.

&#x200B;

I'm struggling to accept that. I let him know that I'm here for him and communication is key but he doesn't really buy it. And honestly, I'm not sure how to proceed.

&#x200B;

This is exacerbated by the fact that his job has him traveling (during a pandemic, I know) so he's been away until a few days ago and leaves again for another week+ stint next week. He's not the most communicative while he's away but he loves his job and said that he appreciates the challenge and the distraction but he feels guilty when he thinks about how his distraction-seeking affects me. And it really does. It makes me feel insecure and needy when he's away having fun at his job, not communicating with me, but comes home and shuts down because he's struggling with depression when reality hits.

&#x200B;

I'm sort of at a loss and would love some insight. How do I support a depressed partner who:   
1) is away for work but also LOVES his work (more than me it feels like sometimes)  
2) doesn't feel communication is helpful when it comes to emotions   
3) we're living during a pandemic - it's not like I can get him out of the house in any meaningful way to help distract himself with me and my partnership   


I'm just frustrated that he's not turning to me during difficult times and it concerns me that his instinct is to retreat. I'm afraid he'll decide that work is the best distraction for him right now, he'd rather focus on that and juggling a relationship is too much. We've been together for over a year, we live together, and I truly see my life with him. I'm not getting the reassurances I need about our relationship right now but how can I ask him for that when he's emotionally unwell?

How likely is it to be great in school although one has ADHD ?

I was great in school, although I didnt have to learn (much). Dont think it wouldve ended well if i needed to learn. 
Also I was pretty interested in school,  I thought that a Lot of stuff was quite interesting. (If there only havent been tests to make this all so stressfull!)
Teachers typically liked me the only thing that wasnt that great is that I never really participated in class. Except for the last two years of school my teachers always told me to say more in class because they saw what I can do in the tests.

So thats the biggest thing that makes me so unsure about that whole ADHD thing. Especially because I cant find anything (or Not much) about that searching Google.

The song itself is very nice, so give it a try if you have time and interest! Anyway, here's the quote:

>*""[...]By thoughts I mean specifically, chatter in the skull*

>*Perpetual and compulsive repetition of words*

>*Of reckoning and calculating*[...]""


**Full lyrics for context:**

A person who thinks all the time

Has nothing to think about except thoughts

So, he loses touch with reality

And lives in a world of illusions

By thoughts I mean specifically, chatter in the skull

Perpetual and compulsive repetition of words

Of reckoning and calculating

I'm not saying that thinking is bad

Like everything else, It's useful in moderation

A good servant, but a bad master

And all so called civilized peoples

Have increasingly become crazy and self destructive

Because, through excessive thinking

They have lost touch with reality

That's to say

We confuse signs

With the real world

This is the beginning of meditation

Most of us would have

Rather money than tangible wealth

And a great occasion is somehow spoiled for us unless photographed

And to read about it the next day in the newspaper

Is oddly more fun for us than the original event

This is a disaster

For as a result of confusing the real world of nature with mere signs

We are destroying nature

We are so tied up in our minds that we've lost our senses

Time to wake up

What is reality?

Obviously no one can say

Because it isn't words

It isn't material, that's just an idea

Reality is

The point cannot be explained in words

I'm not trying to put you down

It's an expression of you as you are

One must live

We need to survive, to go on

We must go on

Ever since I could remember, my mom has been showing me films. We began learning English at . And sure enough, after all these years of excessive exposure to english, I find it to be so easy. To be honest, it's as easy as my native language. In case I have problems remembering or if I don't know the equivalent of a word in either language, I can translate from Norwegian to English or vice versa with zero problem. Pronouncing words in English isn't difficult at all.

One more thing that I want to talk about is that I think an outsider's perspective is something quite different. Online I see English natives make mistakes and complain about concepts in the English language that I find easy to understand. I belive that foreigners can see things about other people's languages in a different and often better light, unlike the ones speaking that language themselves. English grammar and pronounciation can be understood and done on the spot. I don't know how to put it to words, ironically. This goes both ways; hearing people from other nationalities nonchalantly saying things about my language that I didn't know or realized before is mind blowing.

And also, differentiating and switching between dialects is also very easy. If I wanna speak American English, I'll do that. If I wanna speak elite Oxford English, I'll do that. Personally things work at its best if I pretend to be an other person (act, in other words). I'll use and example with Doctor Who. When Peter Capaldi took over the role as The Doctor, there were many complaints about him being difficult to understand. I think he was as undertandable as any other English chap. Maybe a foreigner differentiates between languages more easily? I don't know.

I don't think I perfectly explained my point here, so please ask questions and talk in the comments if you wanna squeeze more depth from this little thought vent. It is so fascinating, and I love the English language!",False,14,0,9,0,0,non_clinical
2020-06-21 14:29:07,My demon's coming back,,"I just want to dump all my thoughts, and feelings here as i don't have anyone to vent out to.

I'm starting to feel empty, it started when i fucked around using dating apps and talking to girls when i clearly have a gf. I know i am an asshole, i'm not proud of it and never will be, and now my gf is having second thoughts on our relationship, we just had a talk and we decided that i should give her time to think things through and decide what to do after. My anxiety and self hate just eats at me and i know i deserve it and i really hate myself so much for it. I really love her, and i want to regain her trust, but i know mere promises can't fix things, and i don't know what to do at this point.

I also am fucking delayed in uni, my batchmates already graduated a year ago, and now i'm 21 turning 22 this year and i still haven't taken my thesis. My parents are expecting me to graduate this year but i know for sure that that is not a possibility. I can't tell them due to the fact that i don't want to break their hopes. I'm so lost in my academics and i have zero motivation to push forward.

In terms of friends, i have almost none. I only have 5 friends that i talk to, and even our conversations are very shallow. I made zero friends during college and it came to a point where i silently cry when i eat lunch at a convenience store as i have no one to go with. I regret every part, and every inch of my self, for being like this and i'm at the point where everything is dull. I also am not close with my parents nor with my only brother. I mostly talk to myself and envision things to keep my mood light.

My only source of ease are the music of mac miller. Listening to him gives me this sense of tranquility, even for a moment. And knowing that he's not here anymore, pushes me more to the edge. The only person that comforts me, isn't even on this earth anymore. I hate it.",False,1,0,0,0,0,depression
2020-07-16 02:40:13,Absolutely deflated,,"I have very bad health anxiety that all stemmed from chronic ED I discovered at 20 it really just ripped apart that invincibility shield most people have. I've experimented with diet and exercise for 6 years now and i'm in a much better place because of it. I'm a plant based vegan now but I know thats no guarantee I won't be impotent in the near future just because of the nature of my ED its improved drastically but again life owes us no guarantees. 

I've done many crazy diet changes lost 80lbs and all that and have always had to have this really fucked up mindset to get there. I followed raw veganism initially as I was really convinced by all these ""health"" gurus that a raw vegan diet can prevent and cure cancer so if it can do that it must be able to cure ED. To anyone who's dealt with a chronic disability that attacks your manhood you have to do a lot of mental gymnastics to cope with that. So I just stuck with that ignored every other aspect of my life and just focused 100% attention on that. So much so when my ED got dramatically better I figured it just proved everything I read right. 

But as the years went on I realized that I was 80lbs overweight, it was my first ever sexual experience and gf, I was used to chronically masturbating to porn so taking all those things into account it does make logical sense why I got so much better. But the twist is I have brother who has the same issues as me but he hasn't found a gf at all for the past 6 years and all he is worried about is dying since life so far hasn't been going his way and our father died recently making him even more fixated on death. I've been trying so hard to get him to become healthier so he doesn't have ED as bad as I did but its hard as eating the way everyone else does is a coping mechanism for him its all he really has. Tasty unhealthy food and escapism in youtube and videogames. 

So he is always finding things to worry and fixate about and recently he has a tiny nodule under his chin just above his throat and hes worried its cancer because why not? And honestly I never even thought it was possible for young people to get cancer I thought they were all fat followed shitty diets and smoked. But thats not the case. Then I started researching and so many young healthy people get cancer for no reason and thats it end of their story. If my brother died I would probably kill myself but honestly just realizing how random cancer is no matter what you do whats the point?

Its like were all in cages in a lions den and one day our cage will just open and a lion will either permanently mame us and leave the cage half closed or just kill us outright. How does anyone live a productive life knowing this? I never understood why he was so upset all the time and so depressed because we still have so much time to make our lives the way we want it. But do we? If nothings a guarantee whats the fucking point. This realization to me has opened up what feels like a mini hell. Your in paradise but you have satan following your around with a pitchfork. I thought I couldn't become this depressed again and feel life is this pointless but here I am again.

My anxiety, insomnia and dissociation have been off the charts with little help from medication and therapy. I was referred to an anxiety specialist psychiatrist. Specialist admitted he hadn't read my file and asked me questions for an hour and a half strait until I lost my goddamn voice and everything he asked the answer was in my file. He then proceeded to tell me he has no idea what to do but will think about it and see me in a week. (I cannot live another week in this state, lol, tf?) He also asked if Ive had an MRI scan of my brain, which I replied ""yes, very recently and all was normal"". 
But my psychiatrist, the one who referred me to this specialist AND the neurologist who gave me an MRI, just emailed me saying the specialist wants me to get an MRI and my psychiatrist is asking me if I've ever had one. But he literally sent me to go get one like a couple of months ago???

**The TL:DR version:** I have PTSD and ADHD and I'm interested in hearing if coaching has been helpful to others in similar situations. If so, what's worked? Anything / anyone you'd recommend?

**Longer version:** 

For most of my life, I've felt unable to exercise control over my behavior or focus on my attention. It wasn't until I was much older that I realized I was grappling with ADHD and PTSD. 

Ever since I was a young kid, I was known as a chronic underachiever who seemed potentially capable of doing a lot, but was completely unable to sit down, focus and follow through. In kindergarten, my teacher had a hard time keeping me in my seat -- I would just get up and wonder around the classroom.  

When I was 9, I was molested at sleepover camp by one of the counselors. Shortly thereafter, my parents got divorced and my family fell apart. My dad moved across the country and I didn't get to see him much through most of my adolescence, while my mom was struggling with chronic depression and crippling anxiety. Although I was occasionally recognized for having intellectual abilities, I barely completed high school and had to take time off college a number of times before finally dropping out. I have had a very hard time holding down jobs (even after getting my dream gig) and have often struggled financial as a result. 

Recently, I've found Somatic Experiencing combined with therapy to be extremely useful for treating my PTSD. What I've realized, however, is that it's not doing much to help my ADHD. For others who've dealt with the combination of PTSD and ADHD, what have you found to work? 

I am intrigued by the option of working with a coach to learn new skills and habits, but I'm weary of working with someone who isn't ""trauma-informed."" Is trauma informed ADHD coaching even a thing?

As a 19 years old daughter, its hard for me to not interfere with their argument each time as i worried of my mom’s safety. 

Backstory, the problem started 5 years ago when my mom made a grave mistake, had an affair and dad get to know of it when the third party came and  confessed. After that fateful day, our lives have been miserable. Everything went downhill. Dad did considered getting a divorce but decided against it due to having both me & my sister who were 14 & 5 respectively. I know, he stayed solely for us. And I appreciate his sacrifices, sweat and effort for raising us to his utmost best. However in the midst of all that, he slipped into depression. He suffered PTSD, he was traumatised. He lost his job, his life was in darkness. He resorted to anti depressants pills to help him stay sane and without it, he felt lifeless. Day by day, I saw how mom betrayal has scarred him, how he changed from the most loving and caring individual into an aggressive, condescending man. For mom, I’m sure she regretted her action, and took over dad’s role of being the sole breadwinner. 

And now 5 years later, although our family still lives in one house. There is no harmony, no tranquility, no pure happiness within the family ties. Every now and then, what seems to be a trivial mistake is turned to a heated argument with dad hurling vulgarities to mom incessantly, which end with mom leaving the house and sometimes didn’t come back for days. In every argument, dad will bring up her sin and condemn her excessively. I understood his situation hence why his behaviour but I could see in his eyes that he wanted to avenge for the pain mom has caused to him. Although dad never physically abuse her, At his peak, when he was furious, he will throw things to her out of rage. Since the first incident, I will always be at mom’s side to Ensure her well being. And at times, I will retaliate and shouted back at him for insulting her to the point like she is an animal. Consequently, I was labelled by him as ungrateful/unappreciative of him and naive for protecting the wrongdoer. He thinks I was siding with mom and “encouraging “ her to do bad things behind his back. He also said I was too young to understand his problems and I should just keep my mouth shut. But for god sake he doesn’t know that I’m hurt and pained as much as he does. I’m affected too. I know he’s still hurting till today because of mom.

For instance, I will stay up all night just to make sure mom is okay and dad didn’t do silly things.

Then the quarantine happened and now I work from home 24/7. Sound amazing? Well as you guys know the mind can do starge things.

I'm deep in a current cycle but right now it's stronger than I've felt in a long time and I just broke down trying to do some work. *Apologies for the novel, but while writing this I realized how much better it felt to type it all out.*

Maybe it's a generational thing, but I'm not at all very open about my depression, on social media or in person. So, to all my friends, even, I'm a go-getter, entrepreneur, over-achiever Type A Person who can give *them* sage life advice. I just tried one of those crisis text lines and it was no help whatsoever. The questions she asked me are the things we discuss in therapy every time. My acute (and sudden) suicidal ideation was subsumed in the face of my annoyance, so I guess that's some sort of good news?

I'm one of those ""after gifted"" kids who showed so much promise, only to find myself in my 30's without a discernible career. I'm a classical musician with a master's degree who can't so much as get hired beyond local productions that don't pay much. I've put thousands of dollars, multiple NYC audition trips, 19 years of study, and 2 degrees into this. I decided a few years ago, as I approached the Actual Age Limit for young artists in my field to even apply for apprenticeships (yes, it's a thing), to start a band and use my skills elsewhere. Essentially ruining any chance of going back. The band is failing because of my lack of leadership and yearlong tumble back into depression. So on both accounts, I'm washed up. I know I should be so lucky to have any performance opportunities, but I expected so much more of myself. I feel like everyone did.

I left a small town and lower income family to strike it out on my own all the way on the other side of the country, so by all accounts I should be proud. But my sister was diagnosed with terminal stage 4 cancer last year, which has complicated my feelings about home and about guilt. How she can come to terms with her own certain cause of death and keep going, unable to drive herself or sometimes walk and I am over here whining about my lot in life? How could I have been so distant with my family for so many years? I'm trying to make up for a lot. I feel like I'm falling short.

I freelance to make money and find myself completely overwhelmed with unfinished jobs that aren't even going to pay that much and today while on InDesign trying to make an ad, I just lost it. Thinking of the band falling apart, of all the work I have left to do, how tired I am, of my sister so so sick. 

On top of that, my beloved cat of nearly a decade died a few months ago. I just adopted a new baby and she's so so sick. I'm terrified of losing her right now even though we are doing everything we've been instructed and waiting on new from the vet. I've spent the last few days cleaning up vomit and diarrhea, encouraging her to eat, giving her medicine. All while my work has piled up.

It feels like one thing after another.

I have a loving husband who knows the demons I deal with. But he shoulders so much of my anxiety on a daily basis. It's too much to expect of one person. He shouldn't have to be everything for me, but he really is. I don't know if he knows just how important he is to me. He's the only reason I've stopped my mental train whenever I start going down that really dark road. I spent many years taking him for granted and after a near-death experience a few years ago I vowed to never do that again. I saw everything he does for me and the fact that he works long hours to take care of us regarding of how much work I have coming in. It makes my current pain all the more poignant.

I feel much better than I did a few hours ago, which is why I'm not posting in the suicidewatch sub. I guess I just need to somehow air this to the world. I'm so used to helping my friends that I'm not used to doing this myself.",False,5,0,6,0,0,depression
2019-09-21 17:21:38,Feeling like the fifth wheel in group situations,Rant/Vent,"tl;dr: When im with friends in a group i always feel like the fifth wheel

so be me:

\- student in a university

\- do lots of sport to manage my hyperactivity

\- be very active in a local sports group

\- have close friends at sports group and university

\- im close friends with most of sports group and rest are friends but we only talk about sports stuff and not personal

\- have few good friends at university

&#x200B;

So the point is: i'm feeling like the fifth wheel

Some examples

When i'm with more than 2 friends from university and walking down the street,

im always the one who ends up behind the row when we enter a narrower path.

And when it happens, they don't notice it,because i'm usually not involved in the discussion.

So i don't push myself through to stay in the row, because i hate putting other people in these situations.

And when im back at home i feel really bad. I hate it because i'm feeling like they don't give a shit and i'm the least important person to them.

I'm the fifth f\*\*\*ing wheel. Not really needed, sometimes ignored, it's okay if im the one being walked over.

For example in discussions this is a feeling i often get.

When it's late and the meds don't work as well anymore, im constantly doubting myself.

Am i too hyperactive? Am i talking too much, because they ignore me? Am i annoying?

Should i just shut up and be quiet because that causes least harm?

I don't want to be the most important person, you don't have to laugh about all my jokes, you don't need to answer what i said.

Please just sometimes answer to what i said and don't ignore it. I would love to not feel like fifth wheel.

Just don't walk over me and make me feel like it doesn't matter if I'm at the party or not.

When we are at a friends house and they sit on the couch, they usually don't make space for me or

ask if i want to sit there when im standing next to it. When another friend comes close they make room.

Why can't someone of them just ask me how life is going? (i dont count the usual hey how are you?)

I often ask them this myself, because i care about them.

Why do i feel like i don't matter? Ofcourse they act normal and dont skip me when we are alone.

The saying fifth wheel fits really well there, because it doesn't feel like i matter in a group situation.

2020-06-21 04:32:07,The most depressing thing about mental illness is knowing you will never be the person you were before everything went wrong.,,"I was terribly insecure as a child. I had all the qualities society deemed negative and my parents never let me go one day without reminding me. I was (and still am) shy and introverted. I have struggled with my weight my entire life. I had acne as a teenager and have acne scars now. I was consistently being told that I wasn't creative, that I was bad at every subject there was. But when I got to high school and found a subject area I was passionate about (and decently good at), I was so happy. Yes, I'm ugly and timid but I can scrape decent grades if I put in the effort. This is something I can be good at. And that gave me enough confidence to step out of my comfort zone a bit.

And then I got to college, and everything went downhill.  I struggled with homesickness and loneliness that stemmed from having trouble socializing with others, and that had a negative impact on my grades. So now, not only was I ugly, fat, not creative, etc., I was also being told I was lazy. Professors that I reached out to told me to stop partying and to actually go to class. What they didn't know was that I attended every class, did every homework assignment, read the textbook multiple times. I just for some reason couldn't scrape something higher than a B. 

My self-esteem plummeted, as did my self-confidence. Everyone around in me in college (and everyone I knew from high school) are so intelligent, so talented, and so beautiful. There isn't a single person that I can't come up with multiple positive qualities of. Except for myself. 

I wouldn't say I was in a good head-space back in high school, but I was definitely wasn't depressed. But now, after multiple sessions with a psychologist, I'm afraid I'll never be the person I was before I was diagnosed. This doesn't seem like something that can be cured, rather something I have to deal with and manage my entire life.

2020-03-03 19:11:12,Overcoming Anxiety,Discussion,"**For those that have overcome anxiety of various kinds, how did you do it?**

**For those that have not overcame it completely but are able to highly manage it, what did you do and why?**

**For those of you who are suffering, what is your plan to overcome it and what are you doing at the moment?**

My thoughts on anxiety is that it is a result of lifestyle circumstances based on past experience/choices. I feel as well that it is a result of this modern world of stimulation and sensitization. Our lives are generally more chaotic nowadays compared to the past, and we have primal instincts such as fight or flight that have no real use in society anymore for the most part. Our lives are largely based on survival, and we often ignore what our heart is telling us. We often stay in situations we don't like because it pays the bills or because its comfortable enough for us to scrape by.

**Anxiety is your body signalling to your mind or vice versa or both that there is some type of imbalance from within or from without in your lifestyle.**

I believe that to overcome anxiety we must become conscious and aware of what in life is holding us back, what is causing us stress, what is hurting our heart, what is hurting our mind/body, etc. I think that we must take advantage of our lifestyle to fix these problems. What we do daily will add up to our state of being and creates our future. You might wonder what you can do to begin calming down your mind and body.. well one thing that you can do is take action in all areas of life, *to the best of your ability*. Developing some type of connection with your spirit or a higher power, or even just some philosophy that you can live and abide your life by. Taking the steps to improving your mind, keeping a daily journal is a great example, or possibly some positive affirmations to reprogram the subconscious. Keeping a good diet and getting some type of regular exercise to the best of your ability. Taking natural supplements such as L-theanine or various other supplements. Sleeping regularly. Cutting out toxic people. Cutting out toxic habits. Trying therapy, to get to the root cause of some of these deeper psychological issues that create dis-ease within your being. These things can't all occur at once, but as you slowly detox every single area of your life you will notice the anxiety melting away. Your spirit/mind/body will recognize that you are now making steps to improve the situation, and you will calm down naturally given a certain amount of time. Be consistent with your efforts and most of all, remain patient.

***Many people are quick to cling to the label of having anxiety and becoming powerless to the situation. They focus on treating the symptoms without ever getting to the root cause. How many of us would still have anxiety if we could have a much more firm grasp on our lives and lifestyle and had an intention set to becoming our greatest version of our self? At the very least we would see improvements.***

Title is relatively self explanatory. I’m sorry if this isn’t the right place to post this, feel free to redirect me to a different subreddit.

My boyfriend has always suffered from severe anxiety- I know he is on medication and sees a therapist. He has also been very outspoken about how spending time with me helps him. 

However, for the last month or so (especially since we have been unable to see each other in person) it seems like he’s constantly blaming things on himself, expecting me to be mad at him over tiny things, and not believing me when I say I’m not upset. He has been having regular panic attacks and saying things like “I don’t deserve you/ I deserve to be dead/I’m a horrible person” over tiny mistakes he makes and is convinced I’m going to eventually hate him. He’s even started self harming recently. 

I feel so helpless. It seems like nothing I say can get through to him and nothing I try and do to make him feel better helps. I can’t seem to make him understand that I’m not going to hate him and that he isn’t hurting me or upsetting me. Plus, my inability to help is making my own anxiety a whole lot worse because I’m so scared something bad is going to happen to him.

Is there any way, even a tiny way, that I can help him feel better or convince him that I’m not always angry and the things he tells himself aren’t true?",False,2,0,4,0,0,anxiety

I feel sad because I think they should consider our situation before having another baby. I feel anxious because of the things that may happen if I fail in life.

I can't talk about this to anybody because my family thinks that having deppression is for weak minded and they don't take it as a serious case.

And it's those school mornings I dread to think back. So I kinda wanted to help him and brought up music to my mom. 
Calming and relaxing music which at the same time isn't boring for the nights and kinda upbeat music which isn't distracting (so as little lyrics as possible) for the mornings.

I could *maybe* understand if my manager was surrounded by 50 women... but there was literally 2 other people present who just happen to be women. I just don't even understand why someone would feel the need to point it out, let alone notice this.

Then today, a customer was purchasing an item that you have to be +18 to buy. He was late middle-aged, and I jokingly asked if he was 18. He said yes and asked ""are you 18?"" I'm significantly older than that, so I continued to joke responding with ""barely!""

The customer then put his card in too early so I asked him to **""stick it in""** again (obviously referring to his card and the card reader.) Which is when he responded **""Oh you're the second pretty lady to ask me that today""** in a suggestive and gross tone. I replied and said ""I'm surprised that anyone has *ever* said that to you,"" and he stopped talking. I really wish I would have flat out called him a disgusting and pathetic excuse of a human being.

What's so fucked up is that he probably thought I was 18, due to the fact that my face was covered with a mask. He could have been an 18 year old's grandfather. And *despite* the fact that I *was* wearing a mask, he felt the need to comment on my appearance and sexually harass me.

I stopped wearing make-up at work a long time ago just so I wouldn't have to hear this shit as often. Can't I just exist as a fucking person and do my job?

I struggled for a long time and overall, they found no concrete source of my issues. When I was 14, and unfortunately right at the time we could no longer afford my therapy, I met a boy. We started dating, and he was the type to not believe in mental disorders, I never stopped believing in them, but I became adjusted to ignoring my own issues, which included stopping medications. We dated for four years and I now have a domestic violence restraining order against him. I left him during my first year in college, and after leaving him, everything I'd ignored came back in full swing. I failed that semester and damaged myself in a few ways. 

And then I met him, my current boyfriend, and he helped turn everything around. He helped me feel loved and understood, and always cared for, he helped me to rebuild my relationships with my parents and my friends I'd lost while being with my ex, he helped me get back into school, which included finding me a major that has become my absolute passion in life, as opposed to trying to be a money machine, he also showed me how to lose weight and become healthy outside of my eating disorders, he also taught me how to drive and I was able to get my license. Literally everything in my life became better and happier within months of knowing him, and my life was, and has since been, perfectly happy. I will admit, part of me still felt like I was ignoring my issues, but not because I was forced to pretend they didn't exist, but because he did everything in his power to show me the brighter side of things, because there wasn't anything to be sad about anymore. And it's been that way for over a year now, my life feels perfect and I wake up everyday smiling and I go to bed everyday smiling. 

-

It has not been the same for the past, maybe, two weeks. I have no idea what it is, I didn't really learn if depression must come from a source, but I don't know what it would be if it must. The quarantine has been a bit bleh, but I spend everyday with the love of my life, it's not ideal, but I feel we have it better than most right now. I'm not even sure I'm really ""sad"" right now, because it feels very physical, and I have nothing to be sad about. My whole body, my heart and my head and my arms and my legs, my mouth and my fingers and my hair and my blood, you get it, it all feels so heavy and so sad, and it makes me feel so sad. Everything makes me want to take a nap, I can barely move my arms to get my water from my nightstand. I started a few new hobbies during quarantine and suddenly dropped all of them. I reconnected with some old friends and it's been so amazing to hear from them, but now I can't even get myself to text them back after days of not responding. Everything just feels so sad and I feel so down and I have no idea why, and I feel so sad at just realizing that this can happen out of nowhere, and can follow me for the rest of my life. There is no truly escaping this feeling, and I am currently struggling with that the most right now. 

I just feel so awful and guilty when it comes to my boyfriend, and the life and second chance I feel like he gave me. He's done so much for me, and I don't want him to think this could possibly be his fault at all. But I'm not sure exactly how to go about starting this conversation, sort of breaking this perfect happiness we've had with each other. I know he'll love and support me through all of this, I just don't know how to escape feeling like a disappointment. I want to have this conversation, but I have no idea how I'd start it, or what I'd say, or how we can resolve this. When I'm alone, I try to practice how I'll open up, and I just sit there with a gaping mouth until I feel hopeless and give up. I think I'm battling my own mind here, rather than anything else, but I'm not sure how to get past it. I've always been able to talk to him about anything, and I also know that I can tell him anything and he'll hold me tight and listen with love, it's just that I haven't really been sad in a long time, and I don't know, I'm sad and it feels bad. I think I just felt like I got to a point of just being grateful to be with him, I wasn't sad anymore, he didn't have to pick up my pieces anymore, we could just be happy together, and it feels like I've taken that away. I have always been his happy girl, and now that I’m not, I just don’t feel right.

2019-06-04 19:58:06,Paper notes vs. typed vs. recorded,Questions/Advice/Support,"UK student here, diagnosed relatively recently. I used to take lecture & class notes on paper because I felt things stuck in my head better (because I couldn't keep up 100% with the lecturer, I needed to prioritise and synthesise information); since getting diagnosed and getting advice from the uni's disability centre, I've switched to typing, which lets me type faster AND means my notes are both easily filed and searchable (compare with paper notes, which I.... quite often do not file correctly, and let's leave it at that).

I'm still somewhat concerned about whether this will affect how well I retain info, but seeing as it doesn't *feel* any worse I'm not particularly fussed.... Really the only main issue is remembering to charge my laptop or sit somewhere I can plug in during a lecture (!)

The centre also advised me to record lectures, which I have been doing, but undecided as to whether to continue - I don't regularly listen back to the recordings, and considering one reason I stopped bothering with paper notes was I didn't regularly go over them I'm wondering whether I should stop that too. That said, I'm about to do my year abroad (languages course) and I feel like being able to go over lectures in case I didn't understand them the first time round might be a good idea...

2019-03-14 22:14:17,Advice needed for ADHD son...,,"My son is 9 years old and is in the 3rd grade. He's been diagnosed with inattentive ADHD since he was about 6. His biological dad and I have been split since he was 6 weeks old, and his stepfather is a great guy, albeit a little harsh sometimes. 

He has been on Ritalin and Adderall ever since, skipping summer and weekends usually. The meds have been working decently, until I guess lately. 

He is very emotional. And angry. He punched a friend in school today for saying he pees in a litter box, after he himself started acting like a cat. He had an incident yesterday while at lunch at school where he threw a cup, and when told to pick it up, he threw himself down on the ground and screamed. Those sort of tantrums are rare, and usually just happen at home.

He has very little empathy for others. He gives no shits about them. He was sorry for punching the kid, but only because he got in trouble. Not sorry for the action, he is sorry for the consequence. It seriously freaks me out. 

 I ask him to throw some snack wrappers away from him and his sister (almost 2) and I get snapped at that he didn't make that *whole* mess, why should he have to clean it up? And everytime, I tell him it's because everyone is a part of this family, and we all help each other. I do 90% of the housework, and 80% isn't mine. 

He also has the other ADHD tendencies...easily distracted, etc.  

I'm so lost. I've tried being nice, being mean, being in the middle. I try to do the 'positive punishment' style of parenting, I tell him I understand he's frustrated, and that I love him no matter what. 

I have ADHD too, along with aniexty, depression, and anemia. He is a hard kid, and I will not lie, I slough off my parenting duties sometimes because I am either too weak or too depressed. I wish I was better for him, I just don't know how to do it. He spends a couple of hours on his tablet after school, but that has been revoked. I do notice when he has more screen time, he seems to act worse.

My husband is great, I just wish he'd be more involved with him. Like playing games with him or whatever. I feel like my son is my burden to carry, I know I shouldn't, but I do. 

We are going to put him in therapy/counseling as soon as I find someone nearby. I've also made an appointment with his doctor to talk about meds.

\> I'm in the UK and studying a biological science BSc, hopefully(!!) graduating with 2.1/2.2

\>Grades super inconsistent; ranging from fails to results in the 70-90% range

\>Work output super inconsistent in part time jobs (in my part time job I once got awarded for superb performance but have also had a poor performance warning in the same job)

\>Super passionate about environment and helping people.

\>Very chatty and outgoing, if a little socially awkward/weird. Love talking to new people.

\>Horrendous time keeping/organisation, but mostly cope through copious lists/calendars/planners

\>Terrible short term memory and can come across as an airhead because of this, but I am superb at problem solving and (probably due to the ditzy first impressions) shock people with my good ideas and innovation

\>Not sure if i'm good with words. I'm a tiny bit dyslexic and can appear slow but when I have enough time to rework a piece of writing I get very good results.

However, my grandparents wanted a different life for their children so they sent them to school. My mom was their eldest child and now we are living an entirely different life far from farming.

As a kid, I would always be in the farm watching people plant or harvest it. Growing up, I've been a bit of an academic and was far from interested in the art of farming.

However, I've always admired my grandparents and farmers in general. I decided to try and help in the farm today. I soaked my feet in mud, burned, and bent under the sun to plant rice. It was tiring work and definitely harder than it looks. Bending for such a long time hurts your back and you have to balance yourself so as not to fall in the mud completely. Imagine doing that for days during planting season.

I (23F) cannot, for the life of me, keep myself focused for long enough to complete the hour-long practical driving test I am due to take next week. I can drive safely, my instructor has no concerns, but my focus just goes at a certain point in that 45 minutes of actual driving, and that’s where I’m afraid I’ll be handed that final critical error or immediate fail! 

Fellow ADHD friends, what was your experience with the driving practical test? Are there any special conditions that your country allows you to have for your tests? I’m excited to be driving on my own, but I’ve always let myself stop if I feel like I’m losing it after 20 minutes. 

If it helps, I live in New Zealand, but I’d love to hear from everyone. Please send good vibes across - yikes!

2020-02-27 18:27:59,"Just an observation, “no phones at the table”",:chat: Just Chatting,"My husband and I were eating at a restaurant and had just been sat when a family that was leaving walked by us. 

The mom nudged her son (probably about 7y/o) and said, “Look, see! There’s no phones at the table”. I could hear her continue hounding her kid as they continued walking out the door. At first, I thought she was talking about my husband and I, and was like why would a kid care about two adults who aren’t on their phones?

So I start looking around to see who she could’ve been referring to, and to my left, was a table with 3 children (looked between 7-12y/o) and their two parents. Sure enough, the children were coloring their kid’s menus together and talking to each other and laughing with no devices in sight. I was a little surprised because siblings these ages usually fight (me and my siblings are grown and we still fight at the table lol), but these seemed to genuinely be enjoying each other’s company. I kept watching them, throughout our meal, through the corner of my eye, and the whole family just seemed so genuinely happy to be together. At one point, the dad even got up, went around the table and kneeled between all the kids to show them how to do something on the kid’s menu and the kids were thoroughly impressed and the mom was giggling at their reactions. It was really heartwarming. 

After noticing them, I thought, ‘maybe most families leave their devices off at the dinner table and social media just exaggerates how addicted kids are?’, so I looked around to see if I saw other families like this one. To my immediate right were two families. One was some women with their toddlers; ALL the women and even the toddlers were face-down in their phone or tablet. Another family was some parents, grandparents maybe, and many children; some were not on their phones, but most of the children and some adults were. 

It was one, single observation (I don’t usually pay attention to the tables around me), so this by no means speaks for the majority. But I was surprised by how heartwarming it was to see a family wholly present together in the moment and seemingly happy to just be spending time together (even the young-ins).

I have scrolled through these threads for a very long time seeking answers to problems without ever having the courage to interact with the rest of the people. I guess the point of this would be rant but any advice/comments are welcomed.

My depression has been going for years but only got diagnosed half a year ago with depression & anxiety when I decided to get help for it. However, all the GP has been doing is just giving me more and more useless tablets. After a time I found a job at Dominos Pizza. Happiest few months I've felt in a long time. Had a plan of making money, moving out and getting my life sorted. One day out on delivery I was completely blinded by the sun and crashed the car. I was physically fine after I got checked out in the hospital, but the car was fucked.

Fast forward several months of mental and physical bullying from parents to present I somehow am still alive even if suicide was the only thing I fantasized about. Few days ago got back  with a girl who I want to meet in a year to date. During this time I had sent out so many CV's with no answers or interviews, but I somehow managed to motivate myself to turn off the PC and start exercising. Today mentally broke down after having a flashback triggered from the accident. I have no idea if it is PTSD, but it wouldn't be surprising. I want to live to at least meet this girl, but unemployment, mental problems and everything else just keeps preventing me from being a fucking normal human being.

2019-03-30 23:21:38,Today I cut ties with my ex.,Venting,"Me and my ex broke up in December. We had dated on and off since February. So it wasn’t a super long relationship but we had spent a lot of time together and we stayed friends. We still get along, we were both in pretty awful places while we were dating and we probably should have just been friends from the beginning. 

One problem came from me having very bad anxiety. Probably for about 6 years at least. Since before I met him. I opened up to him a lot more than I had anyone else ever. And he has still been supportive after we broke up, even if I am often a mess. I’ve thought for a while that’s it’s probably not that healthy and that I’ll stop relying on him so much. Then I have a full blown panic attack and feel no control over contacting him. 

He’s started dating again. I am happy for him, I really am. He’s not had the best time and it’s good that he’s turning things around. It’s good he’s more happy. But it means he’s not around so much. And I feel guilty contacting him because I’m not his girlfriend anymore. Someone else is. He still tells me I can contact him any time I need but It’s like I know my support is on a tenuous string and could disappear any moment.

This week has been a really rough one. I won’t go into details but something very small happened and it made me feel very upset, and I realised I couldn’t do it any more, that I by staying friends I was holding onto all the hurt that I had felt from breaking up. I hadn’t given myself any space or time to heal. 

So, it felt kind of unnecessary and late to do it, but I sent him a message saying everything I should have said then. I wasn’t angry, just honest. I told him I’d miss him. But that I needed  to sort myself out, and I couldn’t do that with him there. 

I don’t think it will have a very big impact on him. I’m kind of nervous about the next time I have a panic attack because I’ll have no one to turn to. But it felt good to have some control, to be the one making the decision. ",False,7,0,6,0,0,anxiety

2018-12-23 16:49:03,Hit rock bottom at work : Suspecting I might have ADD Inattentive subtype,,"Ive started a new internship which lasts 12 months and it helps pay school. Im an assistant advertising manager. I work for magazines and basically my manager sells advertisements to brands (if that makes any sense).

My previous internship I was more into digital communication which I really loved, but i decided to do something more ""global"" and less digital so that employers don't think i'm only 100% digital.

Boy was I wrong to pick this internship.

I have been living pure hell, the tasks are very redundant, a lot of paper work, have to manage invoices, count how many magazines we received, answer emails, do excel tablesheet, phone books, send letters at the post office, deal with accounting anything than advertisement. But i'm an assistant I get it, those are the tasks that they put on their job offer, I cannot complain, I chose this!

I thought at first I could just force myself to do this bcs so many other people did it, but boy was I wrong again.

I've been yelled at by the boss and manager so many times I've lost count and it's always because of the same thing

* Forgetfulness
* Lack of attention to details
* Cannot prioritize
* Taking too much time for one simple task
* Cannot multitask
* Doesn't listen properly when somebody talks to me

So I tried my hardest until I would tell them ""Maybe I should quit and look for something else"", they told me ""No stay, you are here to learn and you will learn how to be more efficient""

Except that being yelled at doesn't make me learn better and definitely not with a team. So I tend to work on my own a lot (which I was criticized about), for fear of being yelled at but it makes it worse and guarantees that i'll be yelled at.

I tried to change my organizing skills, I got a notebook, one colleague gave me a to-do list which caused very little difference. Right now my to-do list is so full that I cannot even look at it and cannot know where to start, I procrastinate or forget to read it a lot.

My manager has told me during these 4 months in that internship many many times that I need to be more motivated, more focused, more present, and care much more about my work. It was partly true, I was not motivated and I've been feeling very depressed bcs of how much I hate what I do and how BORED i am, that's the main problem, I AM BORED.

I've been having erratic moments where I would call my school and say ""I'm going to quit"" they attempted to stop me and brought me back to my senses. Basically: I cannot quit, I've spent too much time there and won't find anything else, and then i'll have to pay school but most importantly won't validate my diploma.

So then I thought, ok, let's face this problem straight on. I took some rhodiola (a plant) which helps with anxiety and concentration, thinking i'm just depressed and it causes less focus. But here I was last week, sitting at my desk with suicidal thoughts, extreme psychological pain at the fact that I am bored out of my mind and cannot sit there no longer doing this routine shit. I have mental fog, moments where I don't remember doing a task Ive done for 4 months everyday... suddenly I know nothing, I have to think fast and intensely to remember how Ive done it.. I cannot remember names, I daydream while doing something which causes a lot of futile mistakes in my work (always details which matter a lot in this company). I do stupid stuff where I forget where I put my pen, or an important object that I need to complete my task, which wastes a lot of time.

Last week, it was that moment where I realized that something is inherently wrong with my brain. I know I already got OCD, depression but I felt like this was none of that, it's something else... I was yelled at again by my boss who asked me when that damn phone book she asked me to do will be finished, it took a month for it, she told me the deadline is Jan 2nd, imagine the stress... Scared out of my mind I won't be able to complete it well.

Then my manager yelled at me bcs I forgot to do something she said was very important. She was in disbelief, tht in 4 months she has been saying the same thing to me over and over and yet i'm still forgetting things, not paying attention, unmotivated and CANNOT PRIORTIZE even with the to-do list they did for me. She judged me and said im a ""millenial"" whos obsessed about ""digital"" maybe its the reason why ""you're so unmotivated"".

It made me cry, and I cried in front of these two colleagues out of mental exhaustion. I felt like a fool, a kid, a dumb low IQ person who cannot complete the simplest of tasks... and I cried out of pity for myself bcs I tried really hard that week and yet still the same shit happens... The manager even said ""I feel like you tried... thats what scares me...""

I've never felt more stupid than right now. I then googled that problem and ADD showed up, and then i started thinking these symptoms match a lot, and then i remembered during childhood that teachers would complain about my daydreaming, me talking too much during class, or me stuck in my bubble, that i would forget my bag before going to school, the keys... my parents always make fun of me to this day about the damn keys, that i always always forget. Since little they tell me to ""open up ur eyes and pay attention more to what I do and where I leave things"".

I took an appointment to a psychologist to get it tested... but in the meantime what can I do to do better. My manager told me that once christmas is over i need to be different and do better.. this scares me, there is no doubt in my mind I have ADD inattentive subtype... will i ruin my whole internship?

Also the instructions they give me are very VAGUE which makes it SOOO hard for me to complete a task. 

Whats crazy to me is that I can be super focused while learning guitar or writing a book, or painting (I love anything creative) but when it comes to something as SIMPLE AS MAKING AN EXCEL SHEET i cannot do. I feel so lost, so desperate",1545584117.0,4,0,7,0,0,adhd

I feel like my whole life has been a struggle and I’m so scared that I’m going to be told “you don’t have anything wrong with you” 

I think I would have a mental breakdown. I know something is wrong and I know that what I experience is not normal or okay. I’m 19 and I made this appointment in November of 2019 and it’s now February, so I’m so scared that this person is going to tell me I don’t need help because then I’ll have to find a new doctor and wait another 4 months for an appointment.

My grades in college aren’t bad at all but I struggle so much to keep up and I used to not even bother when I wasn’t PAYING for my education, but what if she tells me that because my grades are fine then I don’t have it?? I just don’t have any idea what to expect from this appointment and I know the process of obtaining medication is super long and frustrating. I just wonder if it’s even worth it sometimes.

So any advice? Any nuggets of wisdom? Some things I should think about before I go? Will they be super strict in their diagnosis because everyone abuses the drugs?

Update: it was actually super painless and honestly super quick (dunno if that’s good or bad). She just asked me a bunch of questions and prescribed me Vyvanse and said I need an ELG which I am currently waiting for right now.

I am on medication so I can live like everyone else, ever since an incident that occurred 3 years ago, my medication hasn’t been stable and it should be, it can be, but as crazy as this sounds, I have someone who steals my meds at anyones cost, but theirs. They are replaced with a placebo and I’ve been on medication for my adhd for decades and I’ve been living a decent life, with struggles here and there up until 3 years ago. I must have got wrapped up with a doctor who isn’t in the psychiatry field to help people, but rather use people as lab rats. Doing what he pleases, doesn’t even care that my life crumbles every time he strikes. I feel so helpless. I have gone to the DEA, after an incident that caused me to break down my medication, something I never do, I take as prescribed because it works for me that way, I don’t want to get high, I just want to live a routine that I can count on, I broke down my adhd medication at the time and put it in a needle and through my veins because I knew it wasn’t working, I swallowed so many, so to prove myself right I put that right into my blood stream, only to find that I was write, a doctor that I don’t even see anymore has somehow gotten to my life and placeboed me, not realizing or not caring that every time this happens, my life is on the line. These medications help me fight my daily adhd, depression and anxiety, so when some sad soul plays with my brain, they don’t care that they are playing with my life also, anyways the DEA didn’t have much to say, I didn’t give much information because it’s hard to call the one who does what they do out when your not certain who it is. 
Well I got back on my vyvanse a couple months ago with adderal prn , I was feeling good, rarely taking the adderal because the vyvanse works well for me, things were good and then BAM, everything crashed down. I knew it wasn’t me because I have been in this predicament for about 2.5 years, feeling so helpless when this evilness strikes. I go from happy and thriving to not wanting to wake up anymore and that’s how I feel today. Whoever does this, strikes when my doctor isn’t available. Example, today and this whole past week. I have over taken my vyvanse and adderal, just to prove to myself that it’s not me. There is nothing wrong with me during this, my vyvanse goes from good to placebo and that is immoral to me and it’s so crazy that doctors, nurses and pharmacists who partake in this kind of Russian roulette are still doing what they do. It’s because they have received no consequences, so what do I do? I can’t reach anyone who can help me.. death feels like the only way out of this emotional roller coaster that I cannot handle anymore. I’m strong, but I’m human and the expectations some have of me, they can’t even do themselves.. I want to end it all and then that is when consequences will be delivered.

Quake 2, CS 1.6, Runescape, QuakeLive, League of Legends. League took the most of my time and it's annoying, I've lost a highschool crush because of games - I was too busy sitting at the computer, was too shy and couldn't talk to girls. She did like me and at that time I knew she was too pretty, too smart and all in all too good for me. I still believe that. Doesn't matter as much now. I play some Battlefield 4, but it's not addictive, have zero urges, so I've overcame this addiction and ready to move on in life.
I've overcame porn addiction. Which is very harmful, I still might have performance anxiety, but over time I'll be fine, I hope. I've been smoking for over 3 years now, but I can quit easily, so that's not a problem for me really.
I'm currently in derealisation, which I have overcame 3 times in the past, in the course of about two weeks each time. I just wanna be free. I won't ever smoke weed in my life. I believe, that I will overcome this time too. I know, that I'm not very strong mentally, even though I thought otherwise. It's not easy for me to feel joy or sadness. I'm just always being neutral. Somebody might be dieing and I won't get emotional even at such situation. Sometimes I think I don't deserve my parents and everything I have. I have great genetics and  physical health. I do overthink too much, playing scenarios in my head, thinking why are we here and what's the point of life. I even get suicidal thoughts. There's this amazing girl we are friends and I told her everything exept porn addiction.

I've struggled with anxiety/depression for quite a while, and I have always gone through bouts of 'everyone hates you and thinks you're annoying, they'd be better off if you weren't around' spirals, usually when I'm in a really stressed place because of school, life, work, etc. Other times it comes of its own accord.

I feel that way again, and I can't convince myself it's just anxiety. I feel like every time I gang out with my friends I'm annoying them and they would have more fun without me. When I say things in our group chats, people tend to ignore what I say or change the subject—or at least that's what it feels like. I don't have a car, and I feel like people hate me when I ask them for rides. It makes me want to isolate myself from everyone so I stop being such a bother, but I also want help and support from the people I care about. I don't want to tell people how I feel because that feels really selfish, and I don't want to bog people down or annoy them.

I just feel really lonely and like I am a bother to everyone around me, and that I don't deserve my friends. I don't know what to do to make myself feel better, so I just don't go out with anyone, then I feel more lonely, etc. 

TL;DR I feel like I am annoying my friends and they don't want me around, but the more I isolate myself the more needy and annoying I feel, and the more I don't want to ask anyone to hang out or agree to go out with the group, and the cycle repeats itself.

2019-10-22 11:09:51,"[F25] thought I have this bitch tamed, moved to another country, resulted in full blown anxiety and depression",Advice Needed,"Hello.   
I have had anxiety issues since I can remember. I think I had my first anxiety attack when I was 13. I had no idea what was happening and since then I thought I am just introverted and depressed, never really addressed anxiety particularly, even though it was really bad sometimes - I was afraid to talk to people, I left our house only in early mornings or at night so I can get fresh air and avoid people, I once failed exam because my pen stopped working and I was afraid to ask people if they have spare one, I run from shops when employees were helpful, etc. When I went to university and moved to another city I managed to function day-to-day only thanks to being on benzos and/or drunk all the time (yeah I got my degree eventually, my country has pretty shitty unis). 

BUT after my anxiety and other shit caused break-up with the person I wanted to marry, I finally got some professional help and with ""major depressive episode"" and ""borderline personality disorder"" diagnoses I got proper medication and treatment. That was a year + few months ago and I started to feel much better. Still kinda nervous about some shit, but like 90% of unfunctional nonsense anxiety was gone. So I felt pretty awesome and confident and started a new relationship with a guy who lives abroad but is originally from my country and we have known each other for years, but have been able to see each other only briefly during summers. 

And I came to visit him here for a few months to see if this is going somewhere or it's just a waste of our time. I feel like all the progress I have made in previous years is completely gone. I am proud of myself for finding the courage to come here (because guess what, I am anxious about flying, travelling and existing in general), but thats pretty much it. Once again I am afraid to leave the flat, I am afraid to go to a store, I am afraid to talk to people here even though I speak the language, I am afraid I will never fit in, I will never find a good job (my previous experience and education aren't applicable here), etc., you can imagine. 

In theory, I should do small steps, like every day different task I am anxious about and it will get fine in time. In reality, just remembering how exhausting and long that process is makes me .... you guessed it, anxious and ready to give up. 

And I don't have access to any medication, booze makes it worse in the long term so I would like to avoid that. How do I do this, guys? I don't want to give up so easily.",False,6,0,1,0,0,anxiety
2020-01-08 04:13:46,Advice- Brother wants to be dependent on my for his anxiety,Advice Needed,"Tl; dr- brother (22, m) lived with abusive narcassistic father for 4 years, got paranoid due to social anxiety, got cheated on by live-in girlfriend, had a nervous breakdown and is now trying to fully depend on me (24, f) without helping himself.


I'm really sorry if this is too long to read, but I had to add details for context. I'm running out of hope so any advice is welcome. 


So I've been dealing with anxiety and depression ever since I can remember. We had an abusive, narcassistic father and when my parents separated 9 years ago, I chose to live with my mom and my brother with my dad. My mother wasn't very emotionally supportive and wasn't affectionate either, but she never abused me and I was usually fending for myself. Every time I would have a breakdown, I would pick myself up and get stronger. The depression isn't gone, but I haven't stopped trying to help myself either. 


My brother, on the other hand, had it really really rough. He stayed with my dad because he felt sorry for him- my dad had depression and PTSD, and my brother thought they would live together happily as a father-son duo. They didn't. He would constantly manipulate him into asking my mom for money- they lived in a tiny room, off of lentils and rice for almost two years because my father didn't want to touch his pension as he was getting good interest on it (he had over 200k saved up), he used to beat my brother up, verbally abuse him, try and brainwash him into believing that my mother and I didn't love him and didn't want him. My father got a below-knee amputation and that just aggravated him so much more, but my brother still stayed out of pity for him. My father would literally corner him while on his wheelchair and kick and punch him, even spat on him. My brother never hit back. He stayed for 4 years with him until he finally had enough and he came to live with us. He had a tonne of anger issues and would sometimes bully us and use his physical dominance to scare us. 


Anyways, fast forward 5 years, he's been going to therapy and was getting better, until a family event where he was too socially anxious with my cousins and started becoming paranoid that nobody liked him and just thought of him as a younger version of my father. My aunt indeed had made a few remarks here and there, while my uncle yelled at him a few times. But my aunt talks shit about everyone, and my uncle yells the same at his own sons. It's messed up. Anyways, then his live-in girlfriend of 5months decided that she wanted to talk to her ex and basically just ignored him for days. He ended up having a nervous breakdown and needed to be admitted, but we live in a small town and the hospital here has only one psych ward so being around people with severe mental issues just made him even more scared. He's a dental student and I'm a medical student so we also would have kept seeing all our acquaintances and school mates at the hospital. We signed the waiver and came home and he isn't as bad as he was when he broke down, but now he's trying to fully depend on me. 

I've tried my best to be strong and be as patient as I can, but he won't listen. I tell him gently that he needs to help himself too and he can't just listen to me, but he's adamant on the fact that he's too weak to do anything and that he's trying his best. It's been a week now, I asked him how he was trying his best and he said, ""sitting down and shaking my legs, and pacing around"". That's exactly what he does the whole day. He needs constant reassurance, which is fine. He asks to sleep next to me while holding my hand, and when my mom was at home, he would lie his head on her lap and repeatedly ask if she loved him and if she would abandon him. She's away for work right now so it's just us. He keeps telling me how he's feeling and it's always either scared or agitated, and then he asks me what to do. I told him to try positive affirmations, getting back into his hobbies (painting, sketching, writing), or even just exercising or listening to music. He doesn't do any of it, which is understandable, but then he repeats the whole thing all over again after half an hour or so. I don't want him depending on me because firstly, he won't learn how to figure these things out himself, and secondly, I have to go back to college in less than 2 weeks while he can't even stay home alone for a few hours without having a panic attack. 

I make him all his meals, I make sure he's taken his meds on time, I give him constant reassurance and tell him about stuff that worked for me, but what mostly worked for me was me trying to help myself. He gets even more scared and agitated whenever I speak about him helping himself alone and says he needs to be dependent on me right now, but then isn't showing any signs of trying to help himself and is instead scared that he'll ""lose his mind"" while doing nothing about it but pacing around. I tried to tell him that pacing around isn't really helping himself and he got even more anxious and said that I was criticizing him and not to talk to him like that because it made it worse. He doesn't have any friends he can talk to or hang out with, and his therapist is away right now, so I'm basically the only one around. 


What the hell do I do? I'm trying to be as strong as I can be for the both of us. I love him dearly and he is a good guy, as cliche as that sounds, but this isn't good for either of us. He won't listen and says that I'm criticizing him when I tell him to help himself, but he asks for reassurance and listens to that.",1578554745.0,5,0,4,0,0,anxiety

When I went to him I only told him about my anxiety and I try my best to concealed my lack of desire to live, I thought that by having my anxieties cure I would be able to get over my depression...

After I started with my medication it helped, I found a job and start to plan to move out but the virus hit and I lost my job and all my plans have being put on hold and now I need to convince myself nearly everyday to not hurt myself to not do anything but honestly sometimes that isn’t enough...

Next month I have an app with my psychiatrist, where I’m planning in telling him the truth, but I don’t want him to call any of my family or put me on a psych hold, I just want him to maybe change my prescriptions or give me new copying mechanism without letting my family know about it!

2018-12-31 20:14:54,"Thinking back to childhood like ""wow I bet that would have gone better, had I been diagnosed back then""",,"I wasn't diagnosed until I was about 25 (I turn 28 in two months). I WAS diagnosed with OCD when I was 15, after lots and lots of tests for other things.  


But not one person suspected ADHD. I'm guessing because of the following reasons:  
\-It was the late 90s/early 2000s, and everyone still thought ADHD meant ""hyper little spaz who can't sit still or get good grades"". I was always the weird kid but still maintained ""good kid"" status all throughout school (direct conflict with what people thought ADHD meant)  
\-I was placed in advanced learning classes after kindergarten, because I placed second in the state on whatever the hell test they gave all of us.  
\-I exhibited severe anxiety-related symptoms more than anything, which lead to the ultimate diagnosis of OCD. And who would have thought those symptoms overlapped with ADHD back then? Not a damn person.  


  
Now that I've been diagnosed and treated for the past several years, I've also been researching (as I do anytime I learn something new about myself). And SO MANY TIMES A DAMN WEEK I'm like ""wow I bet that would have gone better, had I been diagnosed back then""  


Example: They put me on ""math probation"" in 5th grade. Because I couldn't absorb the process of long division. I'd understand it sometimes, for a short period of time, but mostly I just stared at math problems like they were foreign languages.   
This lasted my entire life. I am still intimidated and horrified by math. I used to explain it like this:  
when you wake up first thing, you're still groggy and not-quite-human, and you see the numbers on your digital clock. Your brain recognizes them as familiar symbols, you're not exactly confused, but you cannot process wtf the symbols are telling you. It's like only part of your brain is numb, so it can only complete a few of the steps needed to comprehend what ""8:00AM"" is supposed to mean.  


That's what it was like for me in math. Forever. I'd try so hard to keep up with things but it was like my brain just hit ""delete"" halfway through an algebraic equation. And I'd get SO FRUSTRATED eventually I gave up and just started cheating or manipulating the counselors to get me out of math classes. I assumed I just couldn't process numbers, for some unknown reason. Even though I wanted a career in science or mental health fields, I gave up on the idea of college because I can't even do long division, to this day.   


But now I work in an engineering/design department at an extremely well-known renewable energy company. I've been teaching myself and others the many equations we use for electrical and structural engineering. It suddenly hit me that I was fully capable of doing ""slightly-more-complex"" math.  


I just went a good 20-ish years without the help I needed, and got sick of always failing and feeling stupid.  


SO HOW MANY OTHER THINGS JUST SLIPPED ON BY, LIKE THIS?

2018-11-25 19:30:54,Old guy with ADHD - Can't Use Meds,,"tldr: ADHD is totally destroying my life. Can't take meds.

&#x200B;

So, I'm a 62 year old guy who two years ago, got diagnosed with ADHD by my psychiatrist. In 2014, I had quintuple bypass surgery and 3 of my grafts collapsed. One was repairable with a stent, so I'm running about 80%. I have to take a bunch of heart medication that has to be balanced perfectly as it gives me severe vertigo otherwise. My shrink tried every available anti-depressant at low doses (supposed to act like other ADHD meds at those doses) he could, but nothing worked. Can't exercise because of angina that is controlled when I'm at rest.

I write software for automated and robotic manufacturing equipment that the companies I work for design and build. I absolutely love the work I do. I look forward to doing it. But no matter what I do, it takes me weeks to do  a day's work. This created such a big problem where I worked, that I had to quit before they fired me. I have a bunch of work to do as an independent contractor, but the problem is worse when I'm home all day. I have to get a real job because of health insurance, but at 62,  it's tough no matter how good you are.

I'm feeling totally fucked and like others, sometimes simply offing myself seems like the best option. I've been blessed all my life and have lived 10 times the life of many others - working at a profession I love, professional musician where people pay me money to do something I'd do for free, women who love me, women who just want to have sex with me, blah blah blah - and wonder whether I'm beyond my expired date.

No, I won't kill myself because frankly, I'm too much a coward for that. I've been in engineering for 30 years and barely finished high school. I'm completely self taught. I just don't know how to get that fire back. Meds don't help because I can't take the ones I need because of my health. I can't exert myself.

2019-05-06 17:09:29,The famous Job Interview - Any thoughts?,Advice Needed,"Hello everyone. Hope you're doing okay today.

&#x200B;

By the title of this post, you could tell that I'm not.

&#x200B;

So, I suffer from ergophobia. And I've been pretty ""passive"" for the last 10-11 months, since I finished college and got my degree. I was literally living with my parents (still am) and I haven't done anything at all in terms of searching for a job, looking for opportunities and such.

&#x200B;

I mean, I am taking this time because I am not receiving any help (professionally and non-pro) in treating this thing. I am literally scared as hell, and the sudden change that these opportunities will provoke are a huge deal to me.

&#x200B;

I started taking a small course about 2 months ago, it's just a small thing related to my field. I kinda did not feel anxious about this at all because I set up my mind as a ""course"" and I'm like ""hey, this isn't a big deal, your actions won't make you a company get bankrupt, you're the only one responsible for your own actions, and you're learning!"" So I go in there fine.

&#x200B;

The problem started when the person responsible for dictating the course talked to me about jobs and what not, since she knew that I was slightly good at the subject already (because I took it on college, I just re-took this to get a certificate). And she told me that she could recommend to some people that she knows are looking for employees.

I was scared as hell, but obviously, since I have no idea how to say ""no"" to that, I said ""yes, sure!"".

The next thing I know, she told me she has sent my CV to a few people, and I would most likely receive calls either today or this week.

&#x200B;

My anxiety skyrocketed when she told me that, a few hours ago. I am certainly **NOT** ready for a job interview, I honestly don't know **WHEN** I'll be ready for it. And I don't know what to do if I actually GET the job, which is very likely.

It's almost like I want to screw up the interview on purpose, so that I can't be picked.

Last year, I went to like, five job interviews and it turned out ""okay"" because I sort of knew I wasn't going to get picked, because they were very demanding spots (like manager level). This time, it's literally the lowest position one can get.

&#x200B;

I'm so angry that people don't understand my situation. Everyone instantly thinks that I'm desperately looking for a job because I'm 24 and already finished college. How do I tell people (in a professional way) that I am NOT ready yet?

I have to do this alone, since no one's willing to help (trust me on this one, there's NO ONE). So it kinda takes me a while to process everything. It's been a year, I know that, but I'm just a slow guy. Everything that can happen to a young guy like me, probably did not happen to me yet, and I'm fine with that. I'll still get it.

&#x200B;

I can't get the proper mindset to overcome this situation. I'm not exactly fearing the interview itself, but the fact that I have to work is the thing that kills me. You know, waking up early, getting to a place that's clearly outside my comfort zone, the fear of screwing something up, fear of not reflecting what my CV says I am.

Not only that, it also seemed to be affecting my relationships with my loved ones too. I am all sad and upset that I couldn't be sociable, so I shut myself up even more.

My insurance did write "" Your price will be higher for choosing name brand over generic"" so is that implying that I can ask my pharmacist for name brand even though my doctor didn't write down no substitution. I'm afraid I will go to pharmacist and they will refuse to give name brand instead of generic if I just ask them without have the doctor write the no substitution. BTW, I live in Maryland and have Aetna Open Choice PPO.

2019-02-06 00:51:19,How I stopped being late for work! (at least for the most part...),,"**1st step: Actually wake up when I need to!**
My biggest issue was not waking up to my alarms, so I looked into getting an alarm clock for the deaf. I bought the Sonic Bomb alarm clock which has flashing lights, a device that shakes the whole bed, and it goes up to 118 dB (this is not a gentle ""rise and shine"" wake up, this is a ""HOLY SHIT GET UP WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE"" wake up). Boom, no more sleeping through my alarms! I also placed it at the end of my bed so that I have to move my entire body to shut it off.

**2nd step: Know exactly when to wake up to not be groggy!**
Getting ready in the morning is difficult enough with ADHD, and being groggy only makes it worse. Your brain goes through 90 minute sleep cycles that go from light sleep to deep sleep then light sleep again. Even if you get enough sleep, if you wake up in the middle of the cycle you're gonna be groggy. I downloaded the Sleep Calculator app which tells you what time to wake up, or if you need to wake up at a specific time, what time to go to bed so that you wake up between cycles.

**3rd step: Leave way more time than i think I need!**
Those of us with ADHD tend to underestimate how much time we need. I kind of work backwards to figure out how much time I'll need. Say my shift starts at 11:30. I find a bus route that gets me there 15 mins early (11:15), and I need to catch that bus at 11:00, so I plan to arrive at the bus stop 5 mins early (10:55). It takes me 5 mins to walk to the bus stop, and 5 mins to get my shit together to head out the door, so I need to be ready by 10:45. But, since I suck at managing my time I plan to be ready 30 mins earlier than that (10:15). I think it'll take me 2 hours to get ready. Leave an extra 30 mins for getting distracted by things, and another hour for the inevitable hitting of the snooze button 50 times. That means I need to wake up 3 hours 30 mins before 10:15, so I set my alarm for 6:45. (TL;DR: arrive 15 mins before shift starts, arrive 5 mins before bus arrives, leave 10 minutes of time before that, leave 30 minutes of time before *that*, and leave 3 hours 30 minutes of time before *that*) 

**4th step: Stop losing track of time!**
Another big issue which usually goes like this: ""I've got until 10:45 to do my makeup"" *starts with eyebrows*  *tries to fix all the tiny imperfections* ""what do you mean it's 11:30?!"". So what I've started doing is setting 5 or 10 minute timers on my phone. When my phone goes off and I hit restart on the timer, I have to look at the time since it's right in front of me. Now I'm always aware of what time it is while I'm getting ready!

So to kill time I think about various stuff, be it daydreaming, programming, strategy in computer games or completely random things. In one of the recent shifts I remembered the scene where Shrek and Fiona have fun and turn a frog and a snake into balloons by breathing into them. Naturally, it's completely stupid to think about that, it's a cartoon and not meant to be realistic. But as I laughed at that, I shrugged the scene off with ""They cannot breathe oxygen and turn it into carbon dioxide."" So immediately the question was... What could they breathe?

Naturally there are myriads of questions you can raise, be it the structural integrity of the ice in ice age, the physics behind transformation of scream into electricity etc. What are some interesting things you've come up with?

Btw. here is the result of my research on the Shrek and Fiona breath mystery in case someone wants to tackle it.

Naturally, there is no definite answer, because we don't know the exact composition of Shrekaniverse's atmosphere. We only know that just like on Earth the sky is blue and that there are no weird particles in the air, so the heavier gases have to be transparent. As for Shrek's breath...

\- What he breathes out must be lighter than what he breathes in. Naturally in order to be sustainable, the metabolic reaction needs to be exothermic and in total needs to release energy. It also needs to be doable around body temperature. So that means helium is out of the question, because by itself it is extremely non-reactive and also the only two ways to create helium are thermonuclear fusion - an extremely hot (way hotter than Shrek definitely) and energy demanding process - and nuclear dissolution, which is impossible, because all radioactive elements are solids, not gases. 

\- What he breathes out must not be flammable. 

\- Both the base and the product need to be transparent non-flammable gases. 

Naturally since I don't know too much about chemistry, I asked around. And thanks to a large amount of help I could reach a conclusion that one possibility might be breathing in N2O (dinitrogen oxide) and breathing out ammonia - creation of ammonia is exothermic. This would of course mean that since water is stable and H2 is explosive (especially in contact with O2), the metabolic reaction probably involves an acid probably obtained from food, since if the water had been acidic, the fauna and especially flora of Shrekaniverse would probably not be so diverse and colourful.",False,5,0,6,0,0,non_clinical

I hope I'm in the right sub. Mods, please let me know otherwise and I'll find a better fitting sub.

*Also, I am unsure if there's any triggers in this post. I don't know what a trigger might be.* ***Proceed with caution.***

1.) English is not my native tounge, please excuse whatever grammar mistakes this post might incluse.

2.) I am not used to posting on reddit so formatting might be a bit off. 

3.) This post will probably be pretty long, kudos to those of you brave enough to follow my story til the end. 

&#x200B;

**Now for the post.**

&#x200B;

As the title states, I feel lost. Like totally lost.

Do you ever just wake up in bed with panic? Nothing has happened, nothing has changed. You're in your own bed comfortable and snuggled in but for whatever reason you just wake up in panic. Like if someone is demanding your presense somewhere or that something horribly has happened and you're the reason it has happened? 

I do. Every day. Every day starts of with total panic. After a few minutes as I wake up and come to it usually dissipates and all is well again. Well, almost at least. 

I go about my day, showering, eating breakfast and get ready for work. But somewhere inside there's this tingeling feeling. Nagging feeling. It feels as though my whole body is filled with acid, if that makes sense? I feel like I gotta run and fight, but I have nothing to run from and nothing to fight. Why?

This feeling lingers throughtout the day, no matter what I do. I try to focus on work or some chores at home but it's still there. The only time I don't have this feeling is when playing/making music but I do not have the ability to do that all the time so I figure that I need to address this issue once and for all and get help. 

&#x200B;

I have an idea of what has led up to my current state. It's a number of things but please bare with me. 

1.) My parents got divorced very suddenly and without any real explination when I was about 10 years old. It was pretty violent. Not physically violent but you know like, it happened over a day without any warning prior and from that day forth my parents did not talk to eachother anymore and used me and my brother as messengers. I think this event left me with deeper scars than anyone involved realized. Everyone was preoccupied with their own role in it. 

&#x200B;

2.) I got placed in a school with some people that were not very nice. This led to a lot of trouble and in combination with a incompetent principal, this led to me not being in school so much and starting to do drugs, shoplift and be out all night. I was about 13-14 years old when this started.

&#x200B;

3.) A very close friend of mine who was a few years older died. I had sought comfort and guidance in this man after my parents divorced. He died abruptly by OD'ing on pain meds. I was 15 when this happened.

&#x200B;

4.) I got caught doing drugs the first time when I was 15. Although I think this helped me a lot. It opened the flood gates to all things that had been going on during the crucial years of my development for my mother who finally started realizing the extent of damage her and my fathers break up had had on me. 

&#x200B;

5.) I was falsely accused of raping my closest friends girlfriend during a party. I had no evidence that I had never done it and even though she definatly didn't have any evidence of it happening, my friend, her boyfriend, decided that he couldn't really know what had really happened and thus, he choose to take distance from both me and her. This also meant that my whole group of friends that I had hung out with since I was about 2 years old went away on a whim over something that had never happened. This is probably the most devastating thing that has ever happened to me. Luckily, my girlfriend (Now fiancé) belived me and stayed with me. This probably saved my life and I will love her forever for this. 

&#x200B;

Anyway, these events are what I consider to have played key roles leading up to my mental state today. 

I cannot relax anymore. I'm constantly stressed out, I always have lots of anxiety and I feel like the world is just running away from me. I feel like I'm missing out on life because I cannot see it clearly through all the blackness of my constant anxiety. Is there any hope? Is there any help? 

&#x200B;

I really hope to shed some light over what is going on, and how I can break these patterns. I would really like to start living again.

2020-05-11 05:11:28,dont know what to do anymore,REQUESTING SUPPORT,"Context: I am 17 years old (1 year away from age of majority where I live)

Ever since I was 11 years old, my house life was defined by my mother and her fits of rage. When I was 11 years old, minecraft was very popular, as such my self and my brother (he was 9 at the time) would watch mod review fairly often, however, one time, we were not hungry and chose not to eat lunch. Because of this my mom flew into a fit of rage, assumed we had been watching minecraft, and kicked us out. We were not allowed to come back until 9pm, and for 2 weeks after we were not allowed to come home until 9pm. Since then my mom has not kicked my brother from out of the house, but that has not exempt me from spending long hours outside. In grade 7 I changed schools (was bullied from grade 2-6 in old school), and I learnt fast that I could not trust my parents nor my school to listen/help me with my emotions. Immediately in grade 7 I was singled out and bullied, when I tried to tell the school faculty I was told to essentially get lost. When I tried to tell my parents, they were initially understanding, but after about a week they grew frustrated yelled and scolded me for a few hours then kicked me out of the house for a while.

While I was wandering the streets, I swore an oath I keep to this day, I would never tell anyone how I feel, hence the trow away account.

In grade 8, the situation remained largely unchanged, I grew more and more depressed. I wrote suicide notes to myself then threw them away. I tried to suffocate myself once. I became more and more angry at the world.

In grade 10, I fell behind on some English homework, and my mom in another fit of rage hit me then kicked me out of the house (was -10c). I did not feel safe in that house so I sort of wandered the streets again. Eventually, I sat down on a park bench and wished that I never existed. After a few hours there, a stranger brought me into his house and I broke down and told him what happened. He decided to call the police (he had no other real option). When they showed up after a bit, I begged them to leave me alone as I knew that them bringing me back would only make things worse. They did not listen and told my mom the next time this happened they would arrest her.

Ever since then, she has told me next time it happens she will give them a reason to come, and the moment I turn 18 she will kick me out of the house permanently. Since then I have stayed at school as long as possible to avoid being at home. I have also been doing as much work as possible to save money for when it eventually does happen.

I have hated being in my house since I was 11. These are just some of the things that has been happening to me. There are smaller things too like when I was in grade 9, near my lowest, when my parents told me if I was going to kill myself to just get it over with.

While it felt like a life or death experience getting to the office and waiting (lol) I did actually go and am thankful. He prescribed me 50 mg Zoloft and to up my buspar to 30 mg a day (if anyone has experience with Zoloft/ it's effects, please let me know). I basically told him everything in the hour that's been bothering me etc. He seemed pretty sympathetic, but at the end of the appointment he said a month from now he wants to see me only for a half hour...each visit costs me $180, so I would assume even a half hour (like a lawyer) is the full amount. How can he diagnose me in that half hour? Or maybe he doesn't want to, he didn't mention that it might be social anxiety agoraphobia, OCD. I understand it's early, but a half hour next time isn't gonna speed the process up. I honestly just want to know what I have / or don't have so I can at least put a name to it and not feel alone. He also didn't really talk about coming starategies or like how to beat what I was going through. I think I'm starting to realize at the moment anyway that there is no perfect answer and it's probably going to be 90 percent me 10 percent a professional to get past this mental stuff.

2019-05-01 13:54:14,Graduate School has made my anxiety flare like never before,Work/School,"Hi Reddit. I’m working towards my masters of Education in Clinical Mental Health Counseling currently and am also working full time doing program support at a University. I’m on my second year of coursework and my program is 100% in an online format. I graduated from undergrad in 2015 and went back to school in 2018. 

Since I’ve gone back, I have experienced severe anxiety related to performance and other random topics related to school. For example, have I paraphrased this well enough? Am I covering what the assignment is asking of me? I’m asking a LOT of what if questions. It’s constant. I don’t feel any form of relief until I have my grades back. For me, it isn’t about the grade. I don’t mind not making perfect scores. 

There is no former evidence of any poor performance in my studies. I’m actually extremely smart and driven and I take pride in the work I put out. I ask questions when I need to and I’m used to going the extra mile. But I’m so tired of this constant feeling of “doom” that is present. It makes getting through my readings and assignments extremely difficult. If the anxiety gets bad enough, which it often does, I’ll go into a major depressive episode. 

I’ve been diagnosed with MDD and GAD for quite some time. I’m seeing an incredible psychiatrist and I have struggled to find a therapist I connect with in the city I am, but saw one last week that I’m hoping is the right one. As someone who is studying the field, I feel like I need CBT but I also just think I need to do some self-compassion work. 

I’m about half way done with my program and cannot continue to work through the courses in this much of an anxious state. I’m thinking about taking short breaks in between my courses so I have time to re charge. Anyway, trying to sort it all out and take care of myself at the same time.

All of my friends went and were convincing me to go too. I told them I would come but I didn’t. In my past I’ve been through crippling depression and anxiety attacks. It was horrible and that time could’ve made me kill myself easily. It was at its peak in the beginning year of As level. I remember I would come home every day and just cry.

I’ve been through a lot. Especially with my relationship in the beginning . Me and my bf are almost a year into our relationship now. And believe me when I say this I had changed tremendously as a person and so did he, life has also changed tremendously in a good way and for the most part it’s going the way I wanted it to. All my prayers and cries were accepted. Now life is amazing and my relationship is also amazing ig.

He asked me what exactly I was thinking and feeling so we could figure a solution together. I told him how I was getting flashbacks of the tough times in our relationship and how I remembered I went through a terrible time last year. I was feeling sorry for myself and I was crying cuz it was unbelievable how I made it through that time.

2019-10-20 08:52:37,The Story of This Year,REQUESTING ADVICE,"# 

I’m a 22y/o male and I’ve been struggling with depression and anxiety since before I can even remember. I was put into the foster care system in Australia when I was 3 and stayed there till I was 18. Thankfully I didn’t cycle a lot like most kids and I found a foster family who I now call my real family.

I’m having a really difficult time at the moment, this year had been really really tough. I’m in my 4th year of uni and I’ve failed the last 2 years because of my mental state, I’ve been seeing counsellors and doctors and I’m on medication. 2 weeks ago I got diagnosed with Bipolar II and now been medicated for that. But I just need to vent so I’m going to talk about my year and how’s it’s been the worst and best year I’ve had in a very long time.

So the best year started on the 31st of December 2018. I was at college by myself over Christmas and in news years eve I wanted to spend it with someone because I couldn’t with my foster family. I invited 2 friends that were in my town at the time who came over. We sat and chatted for an hour and they started to get bored, my mate asked if he could invite a friend over to join us, I agreed. This friend ended up bringing a fair few people, I would say around 10. Me being anxious as all shit over everything in life, freaked out and stayed silent. I ended up having a few drinks and with each one became more confident and less anxious. Turns out these people were pretty amazing, I made a friend who was 7ft tall and he was honestly the big friendly giant. I made another friend who I’ll call Max, we hit it off straight away and I’ve never connected so well with someone. We instantly became best friends, he stayed over my place for an entire month until we decided to move out with 2 of our other friends, one of those who was homeless and was desperately trying to find someone to live.

A little back story before we get rocky, I lived at a university where at the time our “flat” (8 bedroom house sorta thing) was located on campus. All 8 people were and still are my closest friends. They are a very important part of my life and they mean the world to me. They are very honest people and they told me before moving that I shouldn’t, that it wouldn’t work out and that the people I’m moving in with aren’t who I think they are and it won’t work out. Me being stubborn ignored all their warnings. I have this bad habit of meeting someone and when I get along with them as well as I did with Max, I latch on and I just want to hang and spend all my time with them and it always ends up ending badly.

Back to the story, I ended up moving in with these 3 people. It was bloody fantastic, I had the most amazing time with them. We would spend all night and all day talking and having fun and it really did mess with my studies and sleep. I dropped studying all together and ignored it and my insomnia got worse. On May 21st we planned on going out, we drank a whole lot and went to the club. My house mates and I decided to take MDMA which we had bought the same day. There was 2 capsules and a rock. Now I’ve done drugs before, I do it recreationally, when I’ve taken MDMA I’ve only ever had it in capsules so I asked to have the 2 capsules just because it was familiar and I get very anxious trying new things. Well, we all took our share, went on the dance floor and that’s all I remember. I woke up in hospital the next day and the doctor spoke to me about what was in my system. The capsules ended up being MDMA, ketamine and ice. My body couldn’t handle the adverse reaction and basically shut down. The doctor send me home and I had the biggest come down that I’ve ever had in my life. It got around that I had taken the drugs and I got into a lot of trouble, I got banned from the uni bar and I was ashamed to show my face at uni and the colleges so I actively avoided it for about a month. During this month I’ve never been so miserable. I cried everyday, I never left my room, I avoided everything and everyone. There was parties in my house and I just laid in my room and cried while the world went by. It may sound ridiculous but I haven’t had a great life and the smallest things get to me.

After the month, I kinda got over the overdose and went about my days. Life started getting a bit better again, there were more smiles and laughter. One of my house mates during the time we lived together was terrible with money. He gets paid at 12:30am every Sunday and goes out every Saturday night so usually he spends all his pay as soon as it comes in on drinks. Because of this, my room mates and I had to cover his rent and food throughout the week. This lasted for a few months. Things started getting worse with the guy, he gets very angry and started masking his problems with drugs- specifically weed. He would go out everyday and get really high so he didn’t have to deal with his problems, my room mates and I were getting very broke trying to support him and it got to the point we couldn’t anymore. He never paid us back after countless promises and he never did anything around the house. One night we got into a massive fight and I kicked him out, we stayed friends and we spoke all the time and we learnt it was better this way. We became closer not living together because we didn’t have the tension and added stress.

(I’m sorry this story jumps a lot, there’s so much content that I can’t really focus)

I didn’t realise till after I kicked him out how much I spent time with him. My other two room mates were sleeping together since the start and they would spend 60% of their time in bed. Because of this, the room mate I kicked out and I got really close because we only had each other. After kicking him out I was very lonely. I don’t deal well with being alone and I constantly need company so I feel okay. The male room mate out of the 2 that were sleeping together ended up finding another girl he liked and he spent a lot of time with her; which left me and the girl to get very close. Now all these people I consider my close friends, but the girl and I became really close and spent a lot of time together. We were just friends, and that’s the way I liked it. We would spend every night chatting and laughing and having a grand old time while my other roommate was off with the girl he liked. The girl he liked who studies nursing ended up leaving for placement. She had to move away for 6 weeks to study so he spent more time with us at the flat. I started getting more and more depressed, just little things getting to me and stuff playing on my mind. One of my biggest stresses were bills and money. Our first electricity bill was close to $700 and that was for one month. I was so stressed about the next one that it made me really depressed. About 5 months after the first bill, our second one was due. About a month before I knew we would receive it I tried my hardest to start looking for ways I could pay it in case it was as high as the first. I desperately were looking for jobs, I started thinking about selling my stuff and I couldn’t think of anything. So I came to the conclusion that I might not be able to pay it, and that if I could, when the next bill came out I would have to do this all over again. So I decided it might be best for me to move back to college. I ended up telling my room mates and they weren’t happy about it, we got into a fight and upset me so much. I was so stressed and sad that I thought I couldn’t take it anymore. So I went to my medicine draw and grabbed every pill I could find and took them. It ended up being about 70 different pills in total. After doing it I freaked out and called my house mates, they both had left to go to a party. The girl came home and rushed me to hospital while the other one stayed at the party to get drunk. The girl was very supportive and stayed with me the entire time at the hospital, my other room mate, Max, didn’t visit me at all. I considered Max a brother too me, I loved him dearly and I tried to do whatever I could for him to show how much I appreciate him. When he didn’t visit me it really got to me and upset me. We spoke and he was angry and upset with me for doing what I did, so I left the house for over a week and stayed at the flat where I used to stay. I waited for him to calm down and I went home, I didn’t want him to be angry and upset with me so I thought I would give him the space.

I started seeing counsellors and psychiatrists. My counsellor helped me quite a bit, she was the first counsellor I’ve actually enjoyed talking too and looked forward to seeing. We worked through my problems and she came to the conclusion that leaving the house would be for the best and she supported my decision of going back to college, so I did. After I told my room mates I was doing this they hated me. They didn’t want to speak to me or see me. They said some pretty nasty things to me, and I back to them.

I lost my two best friends, and my brother.

It’s been just over 2 months since I’ve moved out and I’m still miserable about it all. I think about them everyday and I see all their Snapchat’s together and it ruins me because we used to do everything together. Because I left my lease I’m in debt up to my eyebrows. I had to come up with a bond and 2 weeks rent for my college and I have to come up with money for the bills towards the house that I still haven’t paid, and unable to afford. I’ve taken out 3 loans since leaving which has put me through further debt and I don’t know what to do.

The last 3 weeks have been the worst for me. I haven’t stopped crying, I’ve been using drugs and alcohol to mask my responsibilities and now everything has creeped up on me. I can’t stop reflecting about everything this year and the pros and cons and it’s hard to see the positive ahead. I’ve lost my dog, my 2 best friends, I’m a couple thousand dollars in debt, I’m failing uni and my head is so fucked up I can’t think straight. Suicide is constantly on my mind and I can’t help but think it’s the only way out. I don’t know what to do or who to speak too. I can’t take out anymore loans and I hate asking for help from the people I love and care about. So I’m coming to reddit for some advice, some positive thoughts or anything. I’m lost and hopeless and I think it’s coming to the end of my time. How do I get past this? I don’t think I can do this anymore.

2020-07-16 11:25:08,Bitter about my mother's reaction to my diagnosis,Rant/Vent,"

So, my(24m) mother and I have always had a strained relationship. When I got into elementary school, I showed many ADHD signs. The teachers informed my mother of how I always seemed to drift off during lessons and that I wouldn't hear them when they called out for me whenever I was 'elsewhere'. 

My mother chose to ignore what the teachers told her. She also chose to ignore my struggles I had with basic daily tasks (I couldnt get myself/tasks organized for the life of me) and how hard it was for me to focus on my homework (always had to do them right after school which made everything a little worse, I guess). 

Well, she ignored obvious signs, well aware what those signs meant - as she's told me a few months ago. She ignored them because, and I quote, ""i didn't want the diagnosis to ruin your life"". What kind of bs is that??

If I'd been diagnosed that early on, my life would have been much much easier. 

It's also worth mentioning that, throughout the first 6 years of my school life, she mentally, physically and verbally abused me because I wasnt learning quick enough, didnt get the grades she expected me to get, wasnt able to keep my room neat and tidy, and other things. 

Another thing I should mention, she's a certified social education worker, who, no doubt, has worked with many  kids with ADHD. 

Anyway, last night I sent her a text, saying I got diagnosed and she seriously had the nerve to send screenshots of some  ADHD treatment option for children as if the years of torment she put me through didn't happen. And boy, am I pissed and bitter, maybe exaggeratedly so? 

I'm sorry for the long post, I just had to get this off my chest somewhere where my anger might be understood.


tl;dr: mother didn't get me tested as a child, despite the obvious signs; made my life hell for the coming years; responded to the news of my recent diagnosis by sending treatment options for children and now I'm angry",False,2,0,4,0,0,adhd

2018-11-26 13:02:03,My anxiety attack experiences,,"I would like to get out my thoughts on my own anxiety attacks, and how I experience them. I used to deal with generalized daily anxiety, but I am now on medication, which brings that base level down to zero, which is great.

However, I still do deal with random and intense anxiety attacks. These can be triggered by a particular event, or just build up for no reason. Whatever the reason of the initial anxiety, it usually devolves beyond any thought of the anxiety-inducing event, and just becomes very internalized thought.

Anyways, in my experience, when my attacks start coming on, I will feel them building up for 10-20 minutes before I become completely incapacitated by them. I feel my heart rate increasing, and my thoughts starting to race and repeat in my head. I also notice an increase in self-deprecating and harmful or negative thoughts. I feel myself retreating into my own head, and not being able to be fully present. My response times to other people are often slower and my awareness is severely decreased. Lastly, my back and neck muscles always feel incredibly tight, as if injured. Sometimes I am able to recover at this point and stop the attack from continuing, or it sometimes resolves here on its own, and I can get pack to normal. Usually, however, it continues to get worse

At this point, my anxiety attacks go full blown. My hands start to shake, my thoughts are becoming incoherent even to myself. Often I cannot physically keep moving, and I have to sit or lay down. My whole body, inlcuding my neck, head & back, is shaking or twitching. I often notice that I am rocking back and forth, but don't remember starting to rock. I stutter like hell if I try to speak, and stare off into space intently, and can't seem to focus on anything, just stare right past it. I feel scared, weak, and worthless. Sometimes I will feel an intense need to shake my head back and forth voilently, and do that in order to release tension. It takes a crazy amount of effort to get up or walk somewhere, let alone trying to stop the shaking. I often cry uncontrollably, and hit my head or fist against a wall, pillow, etc. repeatedly. Horrible thoughts about myself are running through my mind, but also I'm trying to fight those thoughts at the same time. I will stutter-talk to myself to try and keep my sanity a little.

The things that help in the moment: distracting myself with small light topics, cuddling or long hugs from pets or people, heavy and warm blankets, cannabinoid oil, and drawing or writing.

Afterwards, I am usually emotionally drained, and can feel an intense sort of apathy towards everything. This experience can throw me into a bit of a funk or mood for quite a few hours. Sometimes I will need a nap to regain some energy, but I at least need an hour to relax in a comfortable environment in order to feel back to normal.",False,1,0,0,0,0,anxiety

Last night, I went to pick up my Adderall at the pharmacy that is right down the street from my house (this will be important later), only to be told that it is too early to pick it up and that I can pick it up tomorrow. I was puzzled because I was completely out and I have been taking it exactly as prescribed. I asked the pharmacy tech when they opened tomorrow and he said 9am, so I said I will come by around then before work which would be around 9:30am. He said that the medicine would not be ready until around 10:30am (I work at 10am). Whatever, I am not one of those people who raises a stink so I thanked the pharmacy tech and went home. Fast forward to the next day, I have no Adderall to take and I head to work which is about 30 minutes from my house. I tried my best to focus at work until my lunch time (3pm) when I would be able to drive to the pharmacy that is right by my house. So I had to drive the 30 minutes to the pharmacy by my house, pick up my Adderall, and then drive back another 30 minutes to work. This took up my entire lunch.

2018-11-17 14:39:05,"Drove to the mall, bought the things on my list - and it all went well",,"I don't usually make these kinda posts, but I'm posting this because today was such a clear indicator of how much my condition has improved.

So, shopping for things in big malls has always been a clear weakspot of mine. It can involve

- driving in high traffic - constant risk of attention lapse and a crash, or just taking a wrong turn
- navigating through new, crowded and noisy areas - causes sensory overwhelming, anxiety
- taking the right actions to find things - requires planning your routes, visual processing of your environment...
- etc

So, as someone with slow processing speed and spotty attention I've always found these kinda situations more difficult to handle well than just about anything else. I've been able to survive them ok by biting my lip, but it's just not at all enjoyable and feels very taxing.

Anyway, today I decided it was time to go buy a few things on my list. Drove to the freshly-built big mall (first time going there), and despite the unusual amount of traffic it went just... well. I felt I was on top of things when driving, even with all the traffic (I rarely drive around rush hours since I bike to work) - didn't have to worry about accidents as long as I stayed focused. Managed to get a parking spot that wasn't 500 meters away, actually remembered to take note of where I left my car, went buying some groceries and kitchen equipment first, remembered everything on my list and navigated the store no problem. Then went to another store to buy some hardware, got all the right things, it went nicely too. No anxiety, no sensory overwhelming. After I was done I went back to my car, didn't get lost, and found the car without having to look around (that much). Drove home.

And all of that was just so manageable - I don't say it was effortless, but now I could actually stay on top of things, manage my direction and not feel lost and helpless. This is really big for me, since this is the area in life I've always performed the worst (seriously), and it's concrete evidence of how much better things are now.

2018-10-19 23:29:35,This has been one of the harder months of my life and I'm worried it won't get better. [Long],,"It's hard for me to vent anywhere else but to a group of strangers. I don't have a therapist (I tried, different story), and my family and my wife are large components of my issues. I love then all dearly, but my dad has never been good with money, to the point where we lost our house when I was a teenager during the recession, and it's due to him never really having a solid, consistent job. He has his own company and at times it has done really well, but in the last two or three years it hasn't. This has led him to borrowing money from several family friends, and worse, not telling my mom. This component of lying has manifested other ways as well in regards to money, and he says he has his reasons and not wanting to worry my mom, but she always finds out one way or another and it has caused some drama in the past.

So this is one component of my conundrum, we, as a family, had a bit of an intervention in June about this and told him what needs to change; he needs to get a second job, anything, to help cover bills and start to pay back people he owes money to, while he can still work on his own business. The problem is, no one kept him accountable and there really are no consequences that we can hold over him other than the obvious of losing their current house (rented), etc. I have never lent him money before, but this week I was finally asked because my parents are a month and a half behind on their rent. Now, I had a good childhood. I love both of my parents deeply, and I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I didn't do everything I felt I could to help them in a time of need. And as it so happens, I have some extra money right now due to saving for a new car for the better part of this entire year. I have a decent job and it pays well. My car is old (2001) and while it runs and gets me from A to B, it's on it's last legs.

So my gut instinct is to help them this time. I decide that $2500 is as much as I can manage, and it would cover everything they owe for rent. I know that they need at least that ease of mind knowing that they won't be evicted so my dad can focus on finding a new job. I had a meeting with him and my brother last night to discuss this and he really does seem intent on working as hard as he can to get a job.

This is where my wife comes in; she is unbelievably upset with me that I decided to give my parents the money, despite it not having any effect on us paying our bills. She believes that I am just enabling my dad to make more mistakes, and she has no faith that I will ever be paid back. I understand the risk I am taking, and as I said, I wouldn't be able to live with myself if they became homeless or something because I chose not to help them. She tells me I shouldn't even be in this position. And frankly I agree, but this is the hand I have been dealt, and I did what I felt was right. She tells me that this is a cycle and it will happen again. And she has every right to believe that since this isn't the first time and old habits die hard. She and I are barely talking at the moment, and my anxiety has been through the roof for the last few days. What do I do if this does happen again, and they ask for more money? How does anyone stop loving their parents enough to tell them no and watch them fail and suffer as a result? I know it's not my fault but I can't help but want to help, even if I maybe shouldn't.

On top of all this, I find out last night that my grandmother's cancer has returned, and now it's in her rib bones, effectively making it terminal. I don't know many details at the moment, but she JUST finished treatment for late stage breast cancer earlier this year and we all thought it was completely gone. her doctor was very pleased with her results and it wasn't something we thought we would have to deal with again.

ON TOP OF THAT, my current job is coming to a close soon. My local office closed it's doors in July this year, and I was kept on to work from home to finish out our last few remaining projects. I'm starting to see that the work is drying up and I need to find a new place of work. I was fortunate enough to interview at several firms and I really like one more than the others, but in the last two weeks they have been very aloof and not returning my calls or emails, despite my returning theirs to confirm that I am available to talk.

And of course on top of all this, the normal every day stress that I'm sure most of us experience.

I know my problems may seem like specks of dust compared to other people's. I know that the overwhelming stress I am feeling now will pass in one way or another. But I can't get out of my own head. I can barely concentrate enough to work the job I do have right now, and I have this feeling in the back of my head that my wife hates me, and that I really did do the wrong thing, and all these other thoughts that are just eating my mind and my days away. I haven't had an appetite in days and I just have this feeling that something isn't right. And I know it isn't. I know I shouldn't have to experience any of this. But we don't live in a perfect world. It's just constant bullshit and I don't know how much longer I can hold my own against it. I tried finding help, and went to see both a psychiatrist and a psychologist. One deemed that I was not medically depressed and had no definable illnesses, and the other, after one meeting, never called me back as he said he would to schedule a follow up. Yes, I could have done more than nothing to go back, but for whatever reason it was so off-putting I couldn't muster the energy to. It was hard enough going in the first place. I can't really share this with my fee good friends, because what can they possibly do? I don't want to burden them with the knowledge of my burdens. And so here I am, on Reddit, feeling fairly alone and without an outlet to vent to other than a wall. I want to feel better. I want to know that the choices I have made are the right ones, and ones that won't lead to someone else hating me for it.

I'm not sorry for the wall of text. There's far more that I haven't even written down but I don't have the energy for more and it's lengthy and detailed enough as it is. I wish there was an easy answer. I wish, desperately, that I could fix this and everyone is happy. But I can't. And I don't know how long I can pretend like I know what I'm doing.",False,2,0,0,0,0,anxiety
2019-12-18 01:05:54,Need advice for helping ADHD teen be successful,Questions/Advice/Support,"My 14yo son is in his first year of high school (9th grade - USA).  At the beginning of the year, we tried to help him get set up with a good organizational system: planner, binder with pockets for each subject, etc.  He's also taking a class called ""Secondary Seminar"" that's required at his school focusing on time management, planning, and other study skills.  We communicated with all of his teachers at the beginning of the year to let them know about his diagnosis and some strategies for helping him in the classroom that have worked for other teachers in the past.

He has taken medication for his ADHD since second grade.  At midterm during the first semester, he had mostly As and Bs with a couple of Cs.  Meanwhile, he has become increasingly resistant to taking his meds.  He feels like they're ""not doing anything.""  His resistance has ranged from just not doing it and hoping we won't notice to lying to us about whether he's taken them to arguing vehemently with us about taking them.  He's also very resistant to doing things like writing assignments in his planner.

For the past few weeks, I haven't been pushing it and have just let him do his own thing.  I'm pretty sure he hasn't been taking meds. He does seem to be a lot less hyperactive and impulsive than he used to be when he was younger and unmedicated.  However, now the semester is almost over, and he is looking at mostly Bs and Cs with a couple of possible Ds for final grades.  He has missing and incomplete work in several classes that is really bringing his grades down -- some of the assignments that are missing are major ones.  He does have a hands-on science class that he really enjoys where his grades have stayed pretty high, but he is also missing some written work in that class.

I feel like it's pretty obvious that he needs to continue taking his meds in order to help himself be successful.  Does anyone have advice on how to have this conversation with him?  Also, my inclination is to ground him from things like video games, social media, etc. until his grades turn around.  In your opinion, is that something that would be helpful?

I want to stop being such a burden on everyone and just leave this fucking world. my gf can say that she understands the mental shit but I know one day I'm going to do something to lose her and then I'll literally have nothing to live for.

2020-06-25 18:19:22,Advice for implementing a routine?,Questions/Advice/Support,"Hi all,
My mom recently broke her hip so I’ve been staying with her to help out for the past 2 weeks (don’t worry, she’s making an amazing recovery). She has a very strict routine—wake up at 5:30 am, walk the dog at 6 before it gets too hot, breakfast, then sit down to work from home around 8. Since she can’t really walk, I’ve been in charge of the dog walking. 

It sucked at first because I hate waking up early. I’m usually a “stay up until 2 am on a work night and then oversleep” type of person. But now that I’ve gotten into a rhythm, it’s been awesome. I have time to sit and have coffee (which I know I shouldn’t be having, but i love it) and relax before I start working from home in the morning. I go right to sleep at night instead of lying awake for hours. I feel happier and more productive when I work, probably because my brain actually has time to switch from sleep mode to work mode. Usually, I just roll out of bed and start working at the last possible minute. 

I’m going home this weekend, and I’m actually kind of dreading it. I’ve gotten into such a good pattern, but I know that without my mom and the dog depending on me, I won’t be able to motivate myself to get up in the morning. Self-discipline has always been a huge problem for me, so I guess my question is, how do I motivate/discipline myself into keeping this routine? My roommate has a dog that I could walk back at home, but he seems to hate walks and it just isn’t the same.

I swear to god my personal hell is being outside in the summertime, moths flying around, and condescending family pressuring me to act like I’m not fucking losing it.

Bugs make me want to vomit, they make me want to scream, and they regularly cause me panic attacks. If I see an open window in my house, It immediately causes me panic because a bug could have gotten inside. If I see a bug in my room I won’t sleep there for a month or more.

And sometimes, on the really rough nights, I can’t find a single room in my house that I can verify to be bug-free. On those nights I can’t sleep, and I often stand outside for hours because I can’t handle being in an enclosed space with something so vile and evil.

I literally can not function during the summertime. That’s when all the horrible things in this world come out of the woodworks and a they’re everywhere. This is one of the major reasons why the summertime is absolute hell for me.

2020-05-16 15:11:01,I guess I need to get my final thoughts about everything and not drag it out,,"*my parents*
Starting off with the arguably smallest issue is my parents. They care too much or too little about me. I told them I am getting bad grades at online school. They called up each of my teachers asking why when it was my fault. Over the top. I tell them my knees is hurting after I had to have metal plates in my knee. They ignore me and I go for a check up later, and I have SNAPPED the plate on the inside of my knee. They didn't care. My privacy kinda blends into parents but I'll make a different one

*my privacy* 
I get basically 0 privacy. I get it, I'm 13 I don't deserve it but this is too little. I was in the lounge room watching a movie with my dad. My mum storms into the room saying ""you need to look at your sons phone"". I was messaging a girl pictures of my two dogs for pictures of her dog but apparently she's controlling me or something. I have to change my passwords because I don't trust them. They made me keep the same password for 3 years and I changed it. If my door is shut they will just bust into my room with no warning. If there is its a single knock followed by a door slamming open in the span of 2 seconds. My sister constantly insists on looking at my stuff and same with my brother.

*my height & body*
I'm a tall kid. 6'4"" at 13. I am so insecure about it. When I was younger I used to just eat and eat and eat so no I'm suffering. I get made fun of behind my back and insulted in my face but I can't do anything. The teachers always pick the opposite side of me because I'm tall so I'm always the one who started it.

*my school life*
For the last term and all last year I was pure dickhead. I couldn't go a day without insulting or hurting someone. I didn't know I was wrong because nobody stood up to me. I realised over quarantine but I still have too much regret and I know I've probably hurt basically the whole years feelings. I have apologised but I still have that instinct of hurting someone to get my way or to get their attention. I'm becoming better but still it's always a thing that can just slip.

*my teachers*
My teachers are horrid. I like two or three at most, one at best. They pick on me for no apparent reason and make sure I learn stuff from year 5. 

*my emotions*
This will be the biggest one by far so bear with me. I'm so not motivated. I lost interest in everything I do apart from 1 thing. I feel trapped in my own head where I constantly have insulting thoughts. Your worthless ugly fat slow dumb good-for-nothing piece of junk etc. my day consists of getting up for school and doing the same thing over and over.

Over the last two months I have hit a really bad low in regards to depression.  It is getting harder to keep it together and to keep myself on track.  To do things that need to be done and to work on projects that I generally enjoy.

My routine mostly consists of sleeping, going to work, and avoiding all thought by playing video games.  It is about the distraction it brings.

While depression has always been an over present illness in my life, I suppose in some ways, my current feelings are being trigger from the isolation due to Covid. Of course it isn't just that.  Recently a few of my social outlets have tanked, either due my own mistakes or due to toxicity of other people.

I recently had a falling out with a board game group I was part of for roughly a year.  As things progressed, one particular member became increasingly hostile towards me.  I could make a whole post on this, but if this were a AITA thread, I think it would be ESH as everyone handled it poorly, including myself.  
Shortly afterwards I found out that I was diabetic (not needing insulin at the moment, but can change if I didn't change my eating habits), and my mom was diagnosed with dementia.

All of this is getting harder to handle.  I have people I love and they care about me, but I still find myself shutting down and also pushing them away.  I realized this and caught myself from doing it, but the urge persists.  Negative thoughts continue to invade my everyday thinking, but as I recognize them and try to shift the way i think, they won't subside. I am wholly cognizant of my of how some of my depression is me battling past trauma and genetics, but even understanding that, it still hard to handle it.   


I think what it comes down to is this,  I hate myself.  Its irrational how I hate myself.  No amount of self-improvement or bettering myself has changed that.  How do I learn to love myself and accept who I am?

Yesterday I ordered a pizza (I swear, this is all gonna come together). Since we ordered 3 pizzas and some fried chicken, it all cost $32.27. My mum was supposed to pay, but she wasn't home yet so dad said he'd pay. Problem was he was short. My dad gave our house helper $17 and I had already had $20 separated for the pizza. I made sure to separate the $3 from it all just to make sure we don't end up screwing up the delivery guy. Gave the cash and enjoyed the pizza all the way til this morning. Just this evening, my dad asked our helper for the $3 from last night. She said that I had it, but I didn't. I started thinking that maybe I \_didn't\_ separate the $3 and I gave the whole $37 to the delivery guy and forgot to ask for change.

Needless to say, I flipped out. That was such a *careless, stupid, idiotic, and downright degrading* mistake.

Mum tried telling me that it was just $3, but my country's economy made it that even spending $2 is a huge deal. And it was a huge deal to me.

I was panicking and flipping out.  Then she started praying and said straight to my face *""I rebuke you,* ***Satan***\*"".\*

10 years of trying to get them to understand that I wasn't possessed and it looked like they finally believed me last month. Now she's praying like I was possessed. *Again*.

Granted I could've calmed myself down. But she still kept going and going *""Get thee behind me* ***Satan***\*""""Our God is stronger than you,\* ***Satan***\*"".\*

Was that what I was to them? **Satan?** ***The Devil?***

Went out for a smoke a while she did that. I hate it. I hate it. I **hate** it.

I hate being this demonized thing that they think isn't normal. That it's all the devil's fault. What if it really was **my** fault? Because it *is* my fault. It's all my fault and I'm just fucking going around wrecking shit just because I lost $3? I'm a fucking wreck and I ruined everything *again*.

2019-12-14 16:12:39,How can I get it into my thick skull that I am not invincible?,Questions/Advice/Support,"This is a problem in many aspects but **this post will be about sleep** (or my lack thereof). Sorry it's a long read! (Also my first post here after lurking for a while, hope it's ok!) 

**I don't have insomnia.** I'd even even say that nowadays I take a pretty short time to fall asleep when I decide to, but that might be because I'm crazy exhausted every time I go to bed. When it comes to laying in bed, phone off, eyes closed, tossing and turning— I'm lucky I don't struggle with that! 

H O W E V E R. I still get... let's check my bullet journal sleep tracker... Ah! **3 hours of sleep a night**! Or an **ungodly amount of all-nighters!** These are then followed by hibernation sessions on the weekends or once I don't have morning appointments, which leads to me feeling caught up, and then starting the cycle again Sunday/Monday night and sleeping at 5-7am or just not at all. 

Sleep is one of those things where if I don't do it properly, there's **no immediate consequence.** So I seem to have convinced myself that the **nighttime is free reign.**

I go absolutely buck wild at night. No one's awake so it's just me, my brain, and the world's biggest info bank so when I don't have something urgent due I'm just **consuming media all night.** Every thought leads to the next, and I spend the night soaking up every piece of input my monkey brain can ask for. 

My reasoning for this instance is roughly, ""**I'd be asleep during this time anyways,** so it's the same amount of time away from productive work. I'm using this bonus bank of however much time I want to do whatever the hell I want!""

**If I have something I need to do,** I end up staying up so doing it because of procrastination of course, but stay up LATE late because I'd take my sweet sweet time because **I bought myself another 8 hours. No urgency,**so I can take my time and get sidetracked without worry. 

In these two instances, it's really just **a problem of me equating not sleeping to 8 bonus hours I get in a day.** And with the promise of ""I'll sleep when I'm done"" and ""tomorrow will carry on like normal"", the nighttime becomes an opportunity for me to **extend whatever I'm doing to finish ""sometime in the future"".**

Before I forget, one more instance! I'm obsessed with journals and planners and bullet journalling and self improvement and organisational systems like I am every time the new year rolls around, so I'll spend hours and hours creating lists, installing and trying apps, creating systems online, designing bullet journal spreads and systems, or journalling every single thought that comes into my brain. That obsession got me to bed at 9:30am today when my hand cramped and I reread what I had, just to realise I didn't care about any of the shit I penned down. 

**Ok. Back to the sleep thing.**

Sleep just seems like such a far away thing. **I know there are consequences** to not sleeping but **""feeling tired"" doesn't strike fear in me** and I function on enough caffeine that should I fall asleep in a zombie apocalypse, my body could probably run me to a safe place without me behind the wheel. **If I'm not gonna disappoint anyone else, what's the point of denying myself those extra hours?** I know there are LONG TERM consequences too but... I don't care about future me lol. 

I'm not sure what I'm looking for with this post— Maybe we can share stories about how not sleeping is super bad, or ways to make sleep a priority, or maybe just give me a ""me too!"" to feel better. 

**TLDR**;
I trade in sleep for 8 hours of magic bonus time. I should probably to not do that, but I have trouble justifying that because I don't care about my health. Send help or sympathy :"")

At almost 28 years old, I finally found a psychiatrist who didn't just shrug and tell me to go on hikes to calm down or tell me he ""didn't believe in labels"" (no seriously, that's what a PSYCHIATRIST told me.) She listened. I told her everything. All symptoms, all feelings, everything I thought might be important and she listened to all. of. it. More than that: She seemed to immediately catch on what was going on. She sent me to get tested, then diagnosed me, gave me a recipe for medication and that was it. It was done. Within weeks I was diagnosed. Ok fine, after that I had a little trouble at the pharmacy when I was getting my shiny new meds, because they couldn't read her handwriting, but apart from that, it was honestly amazing. 

And now I'm...both happy and sad. Excited and angry. Because yeah, I finally know for sure what's going on. But on the other hand I could have told everyone this fifteen years ago. I have known this for so long and no one listened. My parents assumed ADHD just meant having a hyperactive and annoying son. They got my brother tested, but not me. My brother doesn't have it. Teachers described me as ""a dreamer"" and ""smart but lazy, could go far if she ever tried."" My friends just assumed I wanted to be special or wanted attention, because we had another friend who also had ADHD, but who fit the stereotype more. So everyone assumed I was faking it. I've had trouble all through school, quit college twice and not once did anyone catch onto the fact that something might be going on. Until this one woman I found at 27 going on 28 years old.

Since a couple of years I actually did find friends who were accepting and kind and they believe me wholeheartedly (because they're perfect and amazing people), but apart from that the reaction of the people in my life has been lukewarm. I have a diagnosis now and the medication works, but they still don't believe it. And that makes me so upset. I've been saying it for years. I've been begging them to listen for years.

However, I found almonds to be incredibly helpful just for getting some kind of sustenance, even when you have no motivation at all to eat. They’re super small, and can be eaten one at a time if your stomach is particularly unsettled - they also have a simple and inoffensive flavor (although there are a variety of flavors available, if that’s more your thing). They have healthy fats and are fairly calorie dense, which can be a big help especially if eating has become an irregular occurrence. They’re also incredibly easy, as they don’t require any preparation aside from simply opening the bag.

Other nuts are also a great choice if you don’t care for almonds, those are just what I found I preferred. Hopefully this is helpful - I know how hard it can be, and this is something that made a little positive difference for me, and I hope can make one for others too.",False,9,0,4,0,0,depression

2020-01-09 00:28:04,The best decision I’ve made so far,,"First post! Thought this might be a good way to start out ~

I’ve always hated school. Not learning, not the teachers, but the atmosphere and the people. I’ve never had a true friend in school and I’ve been the victim of bullying through a great period time. I’ve wanted to change schools many times, but I was too scared that it was gonna be even worse there, so I never did it. 

In the summer 2018 I saw an ad on Facebook about a boarding school, where the students learned through games and theater. I was so excited! It sounded like a dream and I immediately told my parents that that was where I wanted to go.

Still, I was scared of change and the possibility of being left out. But now I’ve been here for half a year, and I gotta say: it has been the best year of my life. I’ve never met people like me. People I could trust. Who I could talk to about my problems. Who didn’t see me as a weirdo or a misfit, but completely accepted me for who I am, and generally wanted to hang out with me. 

I’ve managed to improve my social skills by A LOT, and learned to love myself a bit more. That might sound cheesy, but it’s true ^^

I don’t know what I’m gonna do when the year ends. But I’ll figure it out when that time comes. Maybe meeting new people isn’t that bad after all ~",1578530066.0,5,0,2,0,0,non_clinical

I did graduate but my final semester was very underwhelming. A few months after graduation and my stressors disappeared we parted ways. 

Since then I’ve gone to work again and started having problems concentrating and felt like I was doing poorly and was about to be fired All. The. Time. My emotional dysregulation also has me avoiding contact with my manager when I have a question for fear of repercussions. I haven’t had a quality nights sleep in years. My relationship with my spouse has also suffered, and he seems like he’s always annoyed or angry at me. I thought of what my my therapist said and went back. She suggested I read “Driven to Distraction” and all I could do was “OH MY GOD” as I identified parts of myself in each case. 

She gave me a referral to a psych and earlier this week I was diagnosed. First order of business is getting quality sleep and judge how that helps me stability and irritability. I’ve had 25mg trazadone for a couple nights, and it’s definitely nice to not wake up every 60-90 minutes and sleep for a solid 4-5 hours is nice. 

My first workday after a decent night’s sleep was better. However, my spouse has not. I’ve tried to share info my struggles and he doesn’t respond. No questions, no feedback. He was pushing me to go back to therapy because he could “tell I was hurting” but seems annoyed or gets combative when I ask if he’d want to learn how to coach me or help me in any way.

2020-06-29 19:46:30,my gfs anxiety is hurting our relationship,Relationship,"So a little back story here. My gf and I have been dating for a little under 2 years now and overall it's been great for lack of a better term. She's always struggled with anxiety but wasn't officially diagnosed  until about a year or so before meeting me. Not uncommon because where we grew up, mental health wasn't exactly talked about. 

She's been rather open about certain social situations triggering her, the physical symptoms, panic attacks etc. I know it's constantly a struggle and I can't imagine what it's like. Up until recently everything has been pretty smooth minus the occasional bickering and panic attacks. I've learned when they come on, to remove her and myself from the situation until it subsides and we are able to discuss it. 

Well here's where it gets a little tricky. We went on a mini vacation with my family. About 7 people in total that she's met on multiple occasions. Overall, it was a blast until the second to last night. We got into a disagreement after she said something rude to my brother which exploded into the worst panic attack I've ever seen. Threw a drink in my face, screamed and berated at me so loud she woke up the rest of the household and neighbors. I tried to give her space until I found out she was trying to drive home. This concerned me because in that flight or fight response, she could've really injured herself or others. I was able to convince her to lay down when the adrenal dump finally came and was left to pick up the pieces.  

Now my family is seriously concerned for our well-being. I'm the type of person that doesn't like airing out disagreements in front of an audience. She explained to me the social situation is what triggered the attack. I'm not calling her a liar by no means. But I feel trapped, embarrassed, and almost scarred by the event. I love her to death but am really conflicted on how everything turned out.

Before I got meds, it always was the way that my concentration levels got lower with the week. As same as my impulsivity control. Meaning, on Mondays it was quit okay, still manageable till Wednesday. On Thursday I at least was able to somehow control my impulses, but then on Friday I just wanted to run away. I dont even know from what. Then when the night came there was too possible outcomes:
First, I get hyper-philosophical (like a low/slight hyperfocus) and have awesome ideas, theories, give speeches to fictional situations, etc. And that while my thoughts are fast but slow enough to let me follow and somehow in a line-like order. In this situations I feel like me and as like everything is awesome and is going to be great. I am like unstopable. Only bad thing is, that I wont sleep and then be tired the next day, but nvm.

Anyways, I found the root causes of my depression and it mainly revolves around my physical appearance and my inability to talk to those around me.

That I make everyone in my home unhappy and everything is my fault. Which I don't quite understand because all I do is stay in my room and cry every day of my life. 

I'm becoming more distant with my friends. I'm not too sure why but I can't be bothered hanging out with them anymore, because all the time I just feel insecure, self-conscious and not too good.

Actually got kicked out of my then-school’s counseling center for refusing to let them record the sessions.

Anyway, been seeing the current therapist for almost a year and right until the pandemic starts, felt like I’d finally gotten a handle on things.

Not the case since the pandemic started. We’ve had virtual sessions since then and the minute this started, the minute this therapist started to get a little annoyed and impatient with me about how little progress I was making. Entire sessions would go by with me ignoring her as she once again gave me advice she knew I knew. Lot of basic bullshit like “well you have to combat negative thoughts” and “tell me some things you like about yourself” and what not. She’s a nice lady overall, granted, but it’s clear she has no idea what she’s doing even after the amount of times I’ve told her about how many bad experiences I’ve had in therapy and how I don’t know how to convince myself I’ll ever be ok.

Last two sessions went disastrously. Two weeks ago, she abruptly asks me to share with her about my history of sexual abuse, and there’s plenty of that to go around. Now I want to be considerate so I give as G-rated of a take as I can about it and suddenly I realize there’s tears softly flowing from her eyes. Feel like a total idiot then.

Last week I was just sullen and zoning out and ignoring her again (it’s not healthy or productive) and she abruptly states that this wasn’t working and that I couldn’t get the care I needed from her. I retorted that after so many bad experiences with therapists, this probably meant that there was no point for me to go to therapy at all, that there wasn’t a single person alive who could cure me. Again, not a healthy thing to say but I was in a rotten mood. She recommends a few people, and ends the call, and we’ve got one more session in a couple days and thats probably when I’m going to tell her outright that I will no longer be seeking any kind of therapy whatsoever.

It’s such a pain in the ass, it took me months to find the current one and she spent the first session going on about how there isn’t a single person out there who can’t be better, and it immensely hurts that she’s given up on me. I don’t think she intended to lie, but she definitely lied by accident. What’s the point of finding another therapist after all of this? Despite everything, she’s still the best therapist I’ve ever had.

I don’t know what to do. Five years for nothing. What are you supposed to do after you’ve bounced around for five years with no results? Anyone who wants to doubt me on this can check my post history as I tend to post on suicide watch whenever I’m having a really bad day and you can see just how deep the abyss goes.

Hopefully not too much of a downer!,,"I wrote the below to my therapist and it felt worth sharing to shed light on how depression feels. I've worked with her for several years, and I am proud that I can now acknowledge when I'm being irrational.

I've never consistently taken medication for my depression. I tried once and was bullied by someone in my family to stop. So, I stopped before it could really take effect. I've never tried again and I'm scared of the side effects. I have found that lots of physical activity helps my mood. I try to do that when I can.

For those who feel like they've ""beat"" depression - what happened? What worked for you?

For those who are not depressed, what goes through your head all of the time? How does it feel to read the below?

This isn't meant to be super heavy, I just honestly want to know what it's like not to be depressed so my silly brain knows it's possible. Thanks!

\---

And now the depression hits.

I'm conscious enough of how my cycles of energy and depression work that I understand I'm being irrationally negative. However, it just hurts. While I'm conscious of knowing the thoughts have little to no merit, I can't help but cycle through bad thought patterns. I can't stop my brain from putting myself down. It's exhausting, fighting against myself.

Makes it difficult to be motivated. Gets me emotional. Which frustrates me. The whole battery of symptoms.

I started thinking yesterday if I have specific triggers that cause me to spiral into a depressive state. Part of it is likely purely hormonal. I can't help but think...if I just didn't X...then maybe I wouldn't be so down right now.

Now that I think about it, I will always be able to rationalize a trigger. No person is 100% all of the time. That is OK. We need breaks.

Yesterday morning in the 5 minutes I spent making breakfast, I suddenly became so critical of myself. At one point I had to brace myself and think WTF. Stop. Ugh. I know better. This is why I fear down time. It's why I love TV. It's why I love being busy. I avoid heavy thinking because it leads to a dark, terrible place. I couldn't wait until the 5 minutes were over and I could start working.

Not surprisingly, the irrational thoughts circle around feelings of not being good enough. I constantly think about being better when I'm not otherwise occupied. I constantly think about all of the ways I am inadequate. How others are better. All of my insecurities come out in silence. I hate being alone because I hate my own company. I am so mean to me. I can't stand it. I try to avoid me as much as possible. At the same time I agonize over this because it is completely non-sensical.

Do people really not have to deal with someone in their head constantly putting themselves down? I envy them.

I blame myself because I have been brought up to do so. I am the most likely culprit. It couldn't possibly be that there are systemic or external reasons for the source of my stress! It must be something I have failed to do with myself.

It is why I am overly apologetic. The other person is never \*wrong\*, I just failed to understand them. This makes me appear weak. It makes me a pushover. But honestly, it started as a survival mechanism.

Right now, I am not OK. I recognize that it's just one of those times where I'm going to be not OK.

I really don't know how to replace these thoughts. I really don't know how to remind myself of the good times in these times of despair. I just need someone else to comfort me which is a job that I don't know how to do. I feel helplessly stuck and I have not empowered myself to get myself unstuck. I've delegated that task to others. How pathetic.

So my depression is my fault is basically where this is going. It is so funny how this thought is consistent with and reinforces my negative thought pattern.

It is hard to get myself to believe that my depression is not my fault. It is a chemical imbalance. It was once explained to me that just as cancer is an illness caused by cell mutations, depression is a disease caused by chemical imbalances. In both cases there are treatments and in both cases it's important to be compassionate.

I accept that I am sick. It just sucks to think about it that way. I don't know if it helps. It allows me to give an excuse of being fragile and I hate how fragile I can be. Notice how I want to be better? Even when I am physically sick (i.e. with a cold), all I can think about is how much better I'll feel when I recover. Being sick is not enough. I am not enough. And the thought pattern continues to spiral...

In these times, it seems impossible to be self-accepting. My brain almost always brings me to the conclusion that I am less than. Even as I think of positives, my mind shoots them down or casts doubt. It's exhausting. I don't even bother refuting my depression because I don't want to be shot down.

I just want to curl up and turn my brain off.

I read over the posting rules and hopefully none of this violates it. I'm not asking for a diagnosis but rather I wouldn't even know how to describe these feelings to a professional if I did seek help.

I recently found myself in an odd position where I have a mental health *issue*, but it's not really an emergency issue. For context: I am in my mid-twenties and have happily been in a long term relationship since I was 16.

I would easily say I'm a little stunted on my emotional growth due to these circumstances, which is why I'm so confused about my situation or even how to describe it. So, *here's my problem*:

*I am a self-control freak.* I don't mean like ""haha watch me do this crazy thing without freaking out"" kind of self-control, rather I literally cannot even fathom what it's like to not have control over one's own body and my mind instinctively fights losing control. There are two situations recently that have really turned this from curiosity to a nagging source of worry whether I should seek some sort of counseling or mental health help. 

First, very recently my partner and I both got drunk. Like, drunker than we've ever been, just to see how it feels. We're big guys and making the kind of drinks we like is expensive, so it takes a lot of money and alcohol to actually get drunk. My partner was barely able to walk, he's rolling on the floor, laughing, crying over how delicious the corndog he's eating is, having a gay old time. Meanwhile, I'm sitting there just thinking about how hard it is to walk like this and what we would do if something bad were to happen while we're impaired like this. Yes, I could feel that the alcohol was slowing me down, but otherwise I literally felt completely normal other than the coordination issues. I was honestly a little jealous that I didn't seem to feel like a different person like my partner.

Second, we recently attended a party with some friends and strangers that ended in a rousing game of Truth or Truth -- nobody actually wanted to come up with any dares because we were really just trying to get to know one another. One of the questions that came up was ""What is your greatest fear?"". Several regular answers came up, either spiders, or snakes, heights, etc., while mine were tied with two very related answers: Dying to an uncontrollable situation, such as a plane crash, bus crash, etc., or getting stuck. Not like a claustrophobic stuck, but getting literally stuck in a situation where you have to wait for either death or someone to come rescue you.

A few days after the party, I sort of came to the creeping realization that all of this might be related and that maybe there's something not normal with how I feel. This was only exacerbated by reading articles about Ayahuasca and Psilocybin causing some people to break down these great walls and feel like different people after their experiences with it. This is obviously not an option as I live in America where these things are illegal.

I have this constant nagging feeling like I need to find a way to release control, to the point that I can actually feel it in my chest like a source of stress whenever it's on my mind. Is this Anxiety? Is this some form of OCD symptom? Is this literally just some form of jealousy or frustration that I just need to get over? I've tried googling this feeling but it just comes up with advice on how to better control yourself, which is the exact opposite of what I *think* I want.",False,3,0,7,0,0,anxiety

2019-07-14 22:57:06,ADHD + Career Decision Paralysis = Abosolute Confusion,Questions/Advice/Support,"**To put things into context:**

* I'm not here to plug myself in for job opportunities. I am simply looking for support through this confusing time.
* I'm a year out of college and have 3+ years of experience working in marketing and advertising.
* I'm a content writer/manager for a digital ad agency.
* I was told the position was going to be creative and help people.
* SPOILER ALERT - None of that ended up being true.
* **I have attentive ADHD and Dyslexia.**
* I wrote this list because chunky paragraphs are anxiety-inducing and I believe in writing content that is simple to engage with.

&#x200B;

Now let's dive into this vat of word vomit.

&#x200B;

**I am having severe career decision paralysis** and having ADHD is a pain in the ass when it comes to job hunting. I have been told that I have a successful career for someone right out of college, but I feel as though I haven't accomplished much and I don't get any personal fulfillment from my current job.

&#x200B;

So, I've decided to do what every sane person would and look for work elsewhere.

&#x200B;

**The thing is,** I can't seem to decide what kind of jobs to apply for. My ADHD is wreaking havoc on my mental health through this process and I'm reaching out to get advice on how not to get discouraged when it comes to finding the right job. I feel like I'm not good enough and can't get my priorities in order.

&#x200B;

**I am someone who has a LOT of ideas relating to other industries all of the time.** I straight-up can't shut my brain off. Sometimes I just Tweet companies that I have ideas for stuff like ""Hey, you ever think about 'X'?"" or ""What if you did 'Y'?"" To my surprise, they actually respond. Kind of random I know, but I genuinely want to help and just see what happens, even if they don't go through with it.

&#x200B;

That being said, I believe that the best way I can help people is through my ideas and creative problem-solving. **Does a job like that even exist?** Sure, creativity and problem-solving skills are qualifiable characteristics for certain positions, but what about doing it *full-time*? Maybe I'm being a bit too idealist and naive here, but it's worth looking into.

&#x200B;

I am sure there are other ADHDers out there who have felt just as frustrated when it comes to finding the right job for them.

Anyways, I liked the ease on my stomach since I would usually have eaten something by 9pm and I get up to pee much less frequently at night..... but I’m running into some other issues that makes me question my time of dosage. Not to mention, I am probably misplacing the peak effectiveness of the drug.

2019-08-10 02:09:57,I'm going on vacation with a friend for the 1st time,Travel,"I'm (F23) going on vacation with a friend (F25) that I met during college in honour to celebrate our graduation. It's my first time going on vacation without my family.

We are going on an island and she has some family living here who generously welcome us.
To go on this island, we have a +6h hours car ride and then +11h of boat. 
We decided to split the car ride in two days because driving 6h straight in the same day is way to exhausting and dangerous. She is going to drive all the way long since I don't have a driving license. 

I'm super anxious of being involved in a car accident. She is a good driver but I'm not afraid of her driving skills, more of the other people's one. I was involved in 3 minor car accidents with my parents and another minor one with another friend who is kind of a bad driver tbh. I also don't have a driving license yet because I didn't have the time during college but also because driving gives me pretty bad anxiety, panic attacks and idk I'm generally bad at it.

I also tend to get sick/anxious when I'm on a boat and I hope that the 11h boat ride is going to be fine. At least the risks of having an accident are minor compared to the car.

I'm anxious because we are two young girls in our 20's and we are an easy target to people with bad intentions. Seeing young girl being assaulted or killed during their vacations left me mortified. I don't want us to be a part of them. :(

I'm anxious for many other things: missing the boat, not getting along with her family, having health issue for whatever reason, etc...

I was truly excited and happy when my friend proposed me to go on vacation with her but at this time I didn't realise how much anxiety this trip was going to give me. I don't have a lot of friend (maybe 2/3, her included) and I thought I had to live the experience of going on vacation with a friend (even if I'm really fine just staying at home). I also have Asperger (I'm getting officially diagnosed after the advice of a psychologist saying I was probably on the spectrum. But basically I knew for years that I was autistic. I've just needed time to realise it).

2020-01-14 07:04:58,Advice needed! How can you help yourself out of an ADHD inattentive moment?,Questions/Advice/Support,"Last night, I was working on an English assignment that is due the next day. When I started, I had ample amount of time, and I knew how to complete the task, what to do and all that. I just needed to start it.  I sat there for a long time staring at the blank Google docs, unable to start,  unable to focus to do the task at hand. What was frustrating was that I wanted to start, and I knew I could finish it just fine if I start it,  but I just felt so anxious, overwhelmed, and not into it at the moment. I just, well, couldn't. I ended up wasting three hours watching YouTube, all the while feeling empty about it, because I feel guilty about not working on the assignment when I obviously needed to.  

How did  I know that it was an ADHD moment?  When I woke up the next morning at 5 and begin tackling the task, everything was fine. I sat down, I started it, and I finished it. All in an hour, when I predicted last night that it would take 3 hours. 

So, my question for you guys is, how do you help yourself snap out of these moments? There must be something you can do to calm yourself down, or etc. to continue working on the task you need to do.

Over the span of 2 days I posted and sold all my living room furniture on craigslist, bought paint supplies, painted my walls, sanded and painted my floors, and now I’m done. It’s been about 10 hours since I finished the second coat of floor paint, and it is dry to the touch. I can also walk on it with socks without it leaving any marks (I used fast-drying enamel ’floor & patio paint’). 

According to the internet you should wait 3-4 days before moving furniture back in... but the wait is already killing me. It’s the only thing I can think of or focus on. I am literally sitting here watching paint dry. I also started moving small things in like lamps, etc, then realized I was being ridiculous and moved them back out. Ugh.

What are your best ways to distract yourself and shift your focus when you’re feeling impatient? Sometimes I almost feel like I am in a manic state when I start hyperfocusing on specific projects.

One of my old extroverted freinds from high school, talked me into, going to a party with him. And with everything going on, i thought going out and meeting new people might be a good idea. Maybe i could even stop feeling sorry for myself for cancelling out on life and start living a little. BIG MISTAKE! 

Before we even arrived at the party my freind tried to talk me into doing amfetamines with him. I said no a few times, but sadly i eventually budged. 
After i took the first line, it soon became the 2nd, 3rd, the 4th line. And all of the suddon i had taken about 9-10 lines of amfetamines along with huge amounts of vodka shoots and beer. Everything being poured into to my system by what i thought was my freind.

I was in no position to say no at any time. And if it wasn't for his girl at the time saying no for me, i would've probably been talked into taking a few more lines. 

My brain was completely fucked the day after. And I had trouble understanding what the fuck was going on, along with extreme anxiety kicking in. 
I got home feeling like shit and riddled with anxiety, while getting ready for my grandpa's birthday. 

I regret doing this so much that even after 6 months, i constantly think about what could've gone wrong. How stupid i was for always saying yes, just to please my freind. 
I could've easily died from an overdose. Hell i think, i even had a minor stroke the day after. 

Ever since then, i've been constantly panicking about what this might have done to my brain. Am i ok? Did i have a stroke that night? Did i lose my last brain cell? (yes). 

Even tho it's been so long i can't really talk myself into being in the clear, from the danger i was in.

I worked in one of the most difficult places you could, on contract with some of the most difficult people. Those difficult people ended up liking me so much that I was considered one of them, even though I was not employed by them. 

The company hired in a new HR rep. My manager and supervisor quit. I had struggled with my mental health on and off, but they made it easier for me to handle. I couldnt handle a 40 hour work week so they said it was fine if I worked 30-37 hours. After the left, HR said no. My status was full time and I was to work 35-40 hours. They also developed a point system on coming in late and not meeting your schedule requirements that I was supposed to sign this week (sent to all of my fellow coworkers). 

I dedicated the past two years to my job. So much so that I revolutionized the way all fellow branches were to operate. I was so good at my job, my supervisor was non-existent in my branch. Everything was handled by me, with the approval of my bosses. They have no idea how difficult it is to keep the people I work with happy. The only reason my location had no problems was because I handled all issues. My direct coworker even contacted me for questions and inquiries. 

At the same time, I already dreaded the 25-30 minute drive to work. I dreaded the stress of keeping the branch manager content. I dreaded going in and interacting with customers. I dreaded getting off of work to go home unhappy, not want to eat or do anything, and go to sleep only to do it all again the next day. I looked forward to my time-off / days off, even though I kept my ring tone up in case my fellow coworker was to call me with any issues or questions. 

I had a mental breakdown yesterday and I dreaded the thought of having to go to work, even though I threw myself into my job and was starting to slightly enjoy it because it kept me distracted from the reality outside of my job. I then received the attendance disclosure form and that's when I made up my mind that I was done. I understand the need for it, but I don't believe they understand the stress of the job and the damage it can cause to one's mental health. 

I was the oldest employee in the program. I was there since it started and I helped set up the other locations that followed my branch. I was also one of the only originals left. So I walked in, gathered my belongings, sent in my letter of resignation, and left. Writing that letter was easy, and I usually hate typing formal emails. I'm slightly freaked out about having to find another job. I also made a lot more than minimum wage so I know that I have to accept a paycut. In the end, if I can get out of this ongoing depression, I'll know that it was worth it.",False,4,0,0,0,0,depression

My ADHD son has trouble getting to sleep. We do a relaxing routine every night - bath, reading quietly, listening to calming music. Still we find him hours later sometimes just staring into space thinking about things, or chattering to himself. Sometimes he’s actually up doing stuff - once I found him doing a math workbook - but usually he’s just laying there wide awake. 

His bedtime is at 7:30-8, wake up is at 6:00 am. When he doesn’t get enough sleep his behavior is markedly worse so I know he needs it!

And that writing this right now is my way of getting out of what I should be doing, right this instant.

I hate that I constantly get berated for every little mistake, but I can't even keep myself from making them. That I make a mess wherever I go, that I can't even think in the right order sometimes, but it doesn't matter, because if I stumble over my words or forget to do something that's automatically proof of my own lack of intelligence. 

I hate that nobody believes me when I tell them I have ADHD, that I'm ""not energetic enough for that, you're faking it for attention""; or that ""ADHD is like saying 'oh look a butterfly' and you don't have that!""

That I fear going home because I know I haven't done something, and that the instant my parents learn of it I will be punished for it. And that I can't tell them why I didn't do it, because they don't believe me - they just think I'm too stupid to understand it properly.

I hate that sitting in class and just listening to the goddamn teacher is so hard, because my brain will inevitably latch on to something and run away with it. That time goes so fast when I'm off in my own head, and when I come back from zoning out I have no idea what just happened and I know for sure that I'm in trouble the instant I need to do something related to this.

I hate that even the things I enjoy - the things I know I love - are lackluster to me, for there will always something that grabs my attention in the moment. And that there's nothing I can do about it, because I feel as if I am not actually in control.

And finally, I hate that I cannot cry - I am not allowed to cry - because I am expected to pretend that I have the basic human ability of actually focusing. 

I need help. I really, really do need help and there's nobody.

My little brother who is now in college a few states away, he's such a smart kid and hardworking too. He seems to be pretty lonely though, he doesn't get along too well with his roommate and asides from maybe one or two people on campus, he hasn't really seemed to make many deep connections with other people his age. 

Earlier this year, he's mentioned that he was interested in buying a nice camera to take up photography, but he's also mentioned wanting to buy a ps4. 

If it were me, I'd enjoy the ps4 more because I am more prone to avoid productivity through distractions. My worry is that he'll become like me if I get him the ps4, that he'll stop going to classes or not practice/study enough in favor of gaming. He's always gotten really good grades, always been good with time management, but I worry about the possibilities. The positive aspect of getting him the ps4 would be that me and him could play games together online (i have a ps4 at home) and he could entertain himself when he's in his room and has time to kill; we grew up playing games together, and when he visits we spend most of our time together over video games.

If I get him the camera, I'm not sure if he'd really use it much because he really has only mentioned it once to me, but also to our parents apparently (i have no idea how many times hes brought it up to them). I'd like to give him the option to grow more as a person, and I feel that the camera could help with that. But I'm not really sure which would be the better choice, or if maybe im just over thinking it, and I don't want to ask him because I want it to be a surprise.

The camera is $100 more than the ps4, but I have a $100 gift card with hotel points i accumulated from work.

Hey everyone! So, I've been surfing for 9 years already, and teaching it for 5 (I'm 21 right now). Before surfing, I was a shy person, I didn't have many friends, I didn't have anything I really liked to do honestly.

But then my mom took me to the beach with her (she started working on a surschool that year) and she convinced me to go for a lesson with a group. I didn't know what to expect, I didn't like action sports that much, I only knew how to swim, but that was it. 

Going surfing that day changed my life entirely.

Since then, I've been to some competitions, although I didn't like it too much (no one was there to actually surf and have fun, but to win only) and I've found my passion in teaching other people how to surf.

Recently, I've been working with the Portuguese Adapted Surfing Association and it has been the most amazing experience I've ever had. Helping people with different disabilities and putting them in the ocean surfing is really hard, but it pays off when you see them smile, it's better than any paycheck I've received.

I'm in the middle of getting diagnosed (had two appointments, meeting with a psychiatrist in two weeks after visits with GP) and simultaneously watching my marriage fall apart, mostly due to ADHD tendencies, such as chronically late, inability to finish tasks, roller coaster emotions, losing focus during important conversations, me interrupting, and focusing on the wrong things.

We were hobbling along before but were displaced after an apartment complex fire and not enough insurance. He's at the end of his rope. I'm feeling like a failure (guess who was responsible for insurance) and watching the one thing I have left crumble is devastating. I am really trying but he said it's just not enough anymore.

I'm in my second year of university but I'm at a first year level due to failing a semester and then only taking 2-3 courses (40-60% course load) for the rest. 

they don't believe meds will help and apparently getting tested for adhd costs $2000 (CAD) here. (edit: I've went to my school's health centre to try and get more info, that was before pandemic hit.) I don't know where to go, I don't know what to do, ever since places closed down I've utterly delayed any sort of medical thing I've ever wanted (including seeing someone about trans stuff). I don't know if I can get through this semester anymore.

my parents pay for tuition but they think that if I just try harder I can do it. probably because I've been convinced of that too. are meds really going to help??? am I stupid for trying to rely on them???? is it even possible to get through university totally unmedicated for severe cases?? am I really just lazy and unmotivated??? I think I want to get stuff done but even when a deadline is coming up, all I get is a horrible stomach pain from anxiety and then NO action to study whatsover, except for maybe 3 minutes at a time and then giving up. I can't sleep right either because I need to study before going to sleep, but I'm not studying, but I'm not doing anything useful either, I'm so sick of it, do I even want to do the work (assignments/studying)??? the drop deadline for full tuition refund is today and I just don't know what to do anymore. I want to get through this, I want to study but for some reason the thought of doing work makes my brain go hmmm nah. it's like it's repulsed to the idea of actually *doing* something for reward. no, it has to be immediate. and it has to be something other than what you're MOST supposed to be doing right now. 

I feel like maybe I'm just not cut out for university but I like solving the problems! When I actually manage to focus long enough to solve something or study/learn something new I think it's really interesting! I can't imagine working a service job or minimum education job all my life, I don't even know what the options are there. 

I don't know, I'm pretty sure no one's gonna read this all the way or care, I kind of don't want anyone to, I'm just so fed up with feeling worthless useless lazy waste of space/waste of oxygen. all I need to do is just DO the damn tasks but I either don't remember what I was supposed to do (usually my mom telling me some chore) or I refuse to do it and I can't figure out why except for maybe adhd and I don't know how to get PAST it! If it's ADHD, how do unmedicated ppl stay on top of assignments??? How do they focus when anxiety is twisting the stomach and there is NO way they'll be able to get enough done??? I constantly put things off ""I still have time"" until ""I have no time and it's pointless to try"". I'm so tired

I sleep all the time I just keep taking naps and then not sleeping for too long and then sleeping too long like 12 hours at a time but sometimes 5 hours and then more naps. I don't know. where is all my time gone? I keep wasting time on stupid games, probably if I didn't do that so much, but if I didn't then I'd spend my time on other time wasting things. I keep going through new mobile games trying to find someone to keep my attention but nothing is right, I lose interest after a few days to a few weeks, always. I don't have any real hobbies. I like creating stories but I can't write and I don't have any reliable/consistent way to organize my ideas so I don't really try. 

maybe that's just it, I don't try??? I dont think I'm trying hard enough, if I really wanted adhd meds I'd get the money for it somehow right? I'd try to convince my parents right??? But I keep thinking if I just try harder I can do it, trying to get meds is too much of a hassle and too expensive and my parents hate the idea. I once went on depression meds and they didn't really help and I stopped after just a few months but weirdly enough I wasn't depressed again after that so who knows. I stopped seeing the psychiatrist because he kept misgendering me even though he literally asked my gender because I told him my name is \[masculine name\].

I started taking meds for it but they made me feel weird so I stopped. I think it may have been that I was just used to being ""on"" 24/7 so having a clear mind just made me feel like I wasn't myself? I don't remember what I took but I know it didn't last long. 

I ended up dropping out of high school and getting my GED then working on my associate's degree. I was somehow able to get my associate's degree by taking night classes and working from part time to full time while I was in school. This was when I was around 17/18 and unmedicated. 

Recently, I've been working towards my bachelor's degree and my adhd just feels...different. Maybe I just notice it more because of my homework? It just feels like it has gotten worse, but I'm not sure if this was even possible. I want to be a lawyer and in looking into the material contained within the LSAT I couldn't help but begin the pattern of my downward spiral. 

I started feeling like I'm too stupid to be a lawyer, that I'd fail the LSAT, law school would be pointless for me to even consider, etc. I also have anxiety and depression that I've been unmedicated for, so you can imagine how much fun I had with this. 

I'm considering getting on medication, and am in the process of getting the details together to get retested before I find a PCP or psychiatrist to get the meds from.

I'm feeling extremely unhopeful about the future right now. I dropped out of college when the pandemic started, I'm 16 thousand dollars in student debt, I have terrible financial habits, and I'm trying to move across the country to at least try and start a new life. 

Along with that, I've had crippling social anxiety and depression since at least high school. I have no friends, and any attempt I try to make friends ends with them seeing me as a creep. A lot of this stems from my gender dysphoria; I've been transitioning to help alleviate this but so far it hasn't helped much.

I'm really scared that I'll be living in poverty for the rest of my life. I don't have access to the therapy I need, nor can I afford good health insurance. I can barely afford the medications and appointments I need to transition using GoodRx coupons, otherwise I've been paying for it all out of pocket and I haven't been able to work for the past 3 months. 

I feel worthless, like a leech, someone undeserving of a happy life and my suicidal thoughts have been at their worst recently. 

I hate being an adult. I grew up in a very abusive household but at least I didn't have to worry about if I wouldn't starve the next day. This capitalist hellscape has made me lose hope just a year after I moved out of my parents house for college and I feel lost.

I was always ""special"" kid and person. Extremely kind to other people to the point where my papered over emotions turned into extreme fears. I'm extremely good at writing, very intuitive in computers (I learn basics of all software in hours, always helping people solving trouble with their PCs) and getting keen on certain subjects to the point I had thought I'm somewhere on autistic spectrum, just not Asperger at all but a bit above (bc I understand sarcasm, irony and humour very well). I had always enjoyed cities, public transport, moody music and selection of certain, very specific topics, It's extremely hard to satisfy my taste.

I watch like four movies per year, read small amount of books, because of anxiety I spend lots of time making memes and low-effort creation (luckily, this is slowly changing and I'm working hard on those habits). Same goes with music, when only one out of 20 songs I listen I like and then I'm repeating it for one month.

I've always dreamt about going to fine arts studies; graphic design degree. I'm from small city and, being sure about my potential and fully prepared, I applied to two colleges in largest cities of my 32-million country - one being very prestige, second ""backup"" way easier to get into.

In my country daytime studying is **free,** which is extremely important because money/student loan problem does not exist in this story.

My country has got conservative fine arts traditions. To apply, you must pass the drawing exam which turns into complete random lottery when other 169 people try to get into your degree too. As you can guess, I didn't, while all my friends from art high school did. I was doomed and applied to applied linguistics instead, hoping for some solid learning, getting new languages, cool people etc. With my french maturity exam on 75% I placed last on list.

Those studies hit me very hard. Adding to my ongoing anxiety, I got literally depressed for first time of my life, hardly able to learn anything. You can see it by advancement of this post - I've probably made lots of grammar mistakes despite ""learning"" this english all year. My ""last hope"" grammar exam got marked as 50% and I must wait 'til September to try again. Most of time I just played fortnite, cried about being unusable. Even walking across my cursed campus was pain to legs, I got very tired from every simple task... I had spent lots of time trying to learn anything in library. And icing on the cake - people here were veeeery different than people in my art school. Absolutely different mindset made it impossible to talk with them. I ended up being almost alone, not single party for whole fucking year.

Jump to now, exam time. Slowly digging out of all the trash, passing exam after exam, writing e-mails to professors to ask them about later exam date. Using free psychic and therapist help. At this moment I just want to finish freshman year using my ""disabled because of depression"" cheat-code from GP and get the fuck outta there.

New year, new possibilities. I applied for graphic design again. Geared with packed, large portfolio drove to city of my dreams, capital of my country which lays only two hours from my hometown.

I got denied with laughable rating - 8 out of 30 possible points. Again.

And here comes the clou and main problem - I just can't accept any half-measures. I want to apply to this fucking certain degree and I just feel that I will got depressed again. Nothing can satisfy me - my language studies, cheap alternatives to art studies, studying something easy also.

Adding more, I'm constantly analyzing my life and comparing it to my dreams. I'm sad that I can't got any friends on current highschool; I feel like I waste my younghood. I had very precise picture of my ""student life"" and currently I feel like I'll never fullfill it. This may come from fact that ""playing with peers"" phase (8-13 year old) was unexistent in my life, because of my weird lifestyle and overprotective parents (they are OK now, they were overprotecting me only in plain school).

Maybe because of this I have this resentment to had perfect social life, full with going to clubs, hanging out on beautiful streets of my capital city, drinking alcohol on beaches and dancing around campfires??? I want to get paid for this dead phase on my life, get my childhood wasted in Minecraft and not having any normal friends back???

**Ending this wall of text, I have question - how to deal with this ""never satysfied with anything"" feeling. How to accept fact that I'm probably not going to my dream studies and not treat this as life waste? How to stop connecting studies with social life and choosing degrees which (in my mind) will guarantee me social life I've never had?**

2018-11-21 02:33:41,Adderall XR Dosage Perspective,,"Looking for perspective on the new Adderall XR dosage my doctor prescribed yesterday. 

I’m in my 30’s and a ‘late in life’ diagnosis by my doctor. I started out on 10 mg Adderall XR about a year and a half ago. I went to 20 mg in February of this year, 25 mg in September, and just got bumped to 40 mg yesterday since my symptoms still weren’t controlled. 

I’m concerned that 40 mg of the XR is a huge dose and I haven’t seen much information online about it. I don’t have any drug/alcohol dependency issues and am also on medicine for PCOS and hypothyroid. I’ve been seeing my doctor for over five years now so he’s had plenty of time to observe my behavior and tolerance for other medicines, but this seems pretty drastic. 

I took the 40 mg dose for the first time today and feel kind of jittery and chatty, but that’s it. I was able to focus MUCH better on work today and had less anxiety. I know side effects can take a few days or more to kick in, but so far I feel pretty good. My SO has noticed I seem happier and much more like my ‘normal’ self. 

Any thoughts or things I should watch out for? Thanks.

2020-04-11 17:28:17,Help me(:,Discussion,"For yearsu I’ve had this thing that’s frustrated everyone around me and I know it has to do with me being a huge overt thinker or maybe anxiety? But I’m terribly afraid of getting some type of illness or disease, so afraid that I search for hours and days upon what’s bothering me and giving myself symptoms. I’ve spent countless days demanding to get my blood drawn, have other tests done to make sure I don’t have cancer or anything. 
I’ve been told off by doctors, friends and family because I will go into a full mental isolation. 

There was one time I swore I had a tick, ticks aren’t found in my state but I stayed up for three days crying and researching over an ingrown hair that was huge. I literally refused to shower or to do anything, I had called my doctor and I cried to my mom. 

There’s another time I had been so stressed for whatever reason that my neck lymph nodes had flared up and at the time I had no idea so I just felt a huge fluid bump behind my ear and I lost it. I seriously thought I had cancer, I remember that was the worst week. I never got sleep, I spent so much time looking up symptoms and I spent so much time looking at the symptoms it’s like I started having them which freaked me out more. I was tested several times and I was fine. 

So I’m having that same problem, so I don’t know if it’s a phobia or anxiety or whatever. But I have an extreme fear of going blind, there’s no sort of history in my family but I know that doesn’t really matter. But it’s like I’ll focus so hard on being afraid of losing my sight that I start losing it. I recently got a birth control implant and I’ve been gettin go off and on headaches ever since and I’ll get pain behind my eye so I’m positive I’ll go blind(: and I have been obsessing over this so bad before I go to bed I expect to not see anything when I said up.

2018-12-02 16:41:50,"A quick vent, but a hopeful one",,"I was diagnosed recently with ADHD, I've only been on meds for about two months and I can already feel the change. This is a vent but also for me to internalize somethings that have bothered me. I'm not unhappy, I'm not depressed and I don't believe I have anxiety. As a student, I was both considered gifted and a talkative little shit. In my home country ADHD, no psychology isn't considered real. Yeah all of it, so if you're hyperactive, you just need ""discipline"", I grew up in an abusive household, which I try to downplay but being anonymous I can say it fully, fuck it sucked. My father was/is an alcoholic in the worst of ways and we were thrown out of the house far too many times for me to count. I didn't have goals and I sure as shit didn't have a life plan, I ended up getting lucky and doing extremely well on the SATs and that opened paths that were previously unconsidered to me. Realizing that I have ADHD and getting a proper diagnosis has caused a lot of mixed feelings. I did well in college, by the time I went I learned to cope with my ADHD and my psychiatrist says Intelligence sometimes masks adhd for some. It is annoying, it's frustrating because I realize part of me didn't believe ADHD was a thing either, had I just sought out help at college who knows what I would have done. There are so many paths unconsidered because I limited myself and its thoroughly frustrating. I considered going to law school, practiced on the LSAT until I was testing the 170s and even a 180. I didn't care about it and I also didn't believe it meant anything but my wife has been on my ass about appreciating my victories so you know, yeah, fuck it, I know I'm relatively smart and I need to use it. I decided to postpone law school though because quite frankly I don't know what I want to do anymore. Also, I don't want to apply this late in the game, applications are expensive and I'm not wasting that money.   
The other thing is so many paths make more sense now, my inclination to start a million projects, to start a business, wtf, why did I wait so long. But I didn't, in 26, I feel like that's old, it's not. I'm a fucking kid, and I need to realize what I have in front of me. I have possibilities and I think this is the part I'm having trouble with. There are things that I didn't think I could do that now they seem possible. For those of you who have been recently diagnosed, the struggle is real, and it'll fuck you up if you don't talk about it. You need to reach out for help and you need to talk through your problems.I have support, my wife is a godsend, I don't know what id do without her, but fucking hell please find support. Talk to someone, itll eat you on the inside if you dont just sort your thoughts out.  
I don't know where im going, and thats okay, there are options and there are a ton of possibilities. Im super stressed and I think internally im freaking out because I dont know what next year will hold but I need to also realize that the knowledge ive gained will and has changed my life irrevocably. There's a saying I heard from Ray Dalio, you can have anything you want, but you cant have everything you want so deciding to make those those hard choices are seriously stressing me out. And they require a major commitment, but think I'm ready for that, no I know I am. And I also know that my potential is a lot greater than I think it is, and I should stop doubting myself. I mean I know that rationally, it doesn't actually work that way but I know it deep down and every blue moon I feel a bit more confident. I need to use that, I also need to push myself harder than ive ever pushed myself because I now know that ive been managing to get by all this time so its time to do more than that. My psychiatrist said this and I think everyone should hear it. For those of you who have just recently gotten diagnosed, realize that you've been getting by all this time, if your treatment is working you'll finally meet the real you, and I'm sure as fuck interested in meeting that version of myself.

2020-06-14 04:26:22,Update: Professional not sure what he is doing with his life (2 years),,"Hello Reddit. I am happy to say that I am a longtime lurker and that this is now my second post. I wrote my original post, link below, approximately two years ago. I was in a bad state of mind then. I felt that I was under enormous pressure and I lacked purpose. It is amazing how much can change in a short period of time. When I wrote my post, only one person commented. He has since deleted his account, so we can no longer see what he wrote. But, I still remember some of it.

I complained about my high pressure, moderately high income job, and about being lonely, while also maintaining the appearance of having a great life. I vaguely recall the other redditer responding about trying new things to make friends, and about how much money he made (a fraction of my income) and that he couldn't imagine being disappointed with what I have. He told me what I needed to hear. I was in a bad spot and I saw no path forward. I lost sight of what my options were. He helped me reset and realize I needed to change something in my life. I immediately started looking for new jobs. My job was what was bringing me down. It is scary to think that I almost did something that I could never undo because my job made me so miserable.

Once I began looking for a new job, I had something to focus on. Something to work towards. That made a tremendous difference. It still took me more than six months to actually find a new job, but I felt better during those six months because I had a plan. It wasn't all great during those six months though. There were some very low lows. But overall, life improved. I eventually got a new job and I love it.  My quality of life has changed drastically. Now that I am happier throughout the day, I have more energy and desire to connect with friends.

Another thing I complained about was being alone on holidays. During the holiday season last year, I had recently started dating a woman. We were not together long enough that we would be doing holidays together. So, instead of being down about being alone, I took a trip. I left town and got an airbnb and it was one of my best holidays in years. I have learned that doing nothing makes things worse. Do something. Anything. There is always something to do. Apply for a job, go for a walk, build a bookshelf, get a cookbook. But don't do nothing and think that there is nothing to do.

So, to the mystery redditer who replied to my post two years ago, thank you for setting me straight. I am doing well now. I read over my original post and can hardly believe I typed those words.

2020-07-09 20:23:40,Help! I'm Stuck in My Sadness,Questions/Advice/Support,"My episode right now feels like in the top 5 worst of my life. I dropped out of college last semester before getting my diagnosis. I've started to go to a place where I'm about to get gut-health help and then TMS, and I finally scheduled a new therapist appointment. I'm going to the gym now, and have been ok on my diet. I've got a job now where I'm working 5-6 days a week, and got decent meds. But for this moment I feel entirely hopeless. My girlfriend of 1.5 years broke up with me a bit over a month ago, after she moved back to our college town to finish up her last year, and said she doesn't feel how she used to about me. We've had some really good connections recently, and it almost felt like we could make it work (I know, I got ahead of myself). She even was about to take me back until I said something dumb on THE SAME CALL WHERE SHE SAID SHE LOVED ME AGAIN. 

But even though I can tell she still loves me, she says she thinks she's pretty much moved on, that she doesn't know if she still has any love for me. All I can do know is give her space and change for the better. I can't take it. I know now that I have almost no hope of dating her again, if I will it won't be for a long time, especially since we both need to figure ourselves out. So I need to just give up since she knows what I think, and that I know I fucked up. I know she'll be back in the area after she graduates, so I'll contact her then if we're both single and we've both grown, but otherwise I need to focus on myself and try to move on. But I don't know what to do. 

I go to the gym, I go to work, I try to eat right and read self-help books. But nothing can make me feel happy. She's the only person I've met who made me love her right away, who loved every part of me, and I neglected her and was too needy. Right when I was about to get another chance, I let my sexual insecurity out again, and said ""I miss fucking"" her. And that dumb comment plays over and over in my head, when I'm alone I can only think of how I let her down. It shows that if she didn't break up with me, it would've been inevitable. And even though I know to make my relationships work I'll have to be better, that doesn't help the fact that I knew I wanted to spend my life with her, and that no matter how I try I won't be able to let go of the hope of getting back with her, even years from now, because I know that the chance isn't technically 0%. I almost wish I could forget about her, but the greatest moments of my life have all been because of her. I know that I'll never be able to stop loving her. Now I'm trying to work on those insecurities, on my interests. 

But nothings interesting. Especially with my concerta, food all sucks. Youtube, cleaning, reading, waking up every morning sucks. My job sucks, where now I have to deliver and be alone with my thoughts that won't stop gravitating to her. I'm living with my mom, not saving much money at all because of how expensive the program is (which I'll be paying for for the next 6 months), and the few friends I have from high school (basically all my college friends are super far away) are always busy. I try to meditate when I can. But my anxiety has been so up and down for weeks, it's killing me. I don't know how to meet people in a pandemic. I'll keep working on myself, but it doesn't feel satisfying, I feel so lost, lonely, stupid, depressed. None of my interests inspire me, I can't get any music out and sad music isn't cathartic, it just makes it worse! Can anyone relate? Any kind words or advice is appreciated.

My head was so foggy that I couldn't even imagine a future or daydream about nice things happening to me.   


About a week ago I brought some St Johns Wort - started taking it twice a day and I noticed my crying went from 10 times to 1 time a day and then not crying at all. I started getting up and doing things but not realising I was doing it  - its like I 'forgot' I was depressed. My mom invited me to the mall 3 days ago and I went without even realising I didn't have enough energy - I just went! I've also been having a bath everyday and started buying new clothes online. I even have been looking up music fesitivals for the next summer - planning my future!  I don't really understand whats happening but it think the St Johns has cleared my head enough to dampen my emotions and I am slowly getting back into living life and getting excited about the idea. Today was my lightbulb moment. I was looking though old photos and I realised ' WTF have I been doing the past 5 months?!?' I just wasted all this time brooding and moaning. In my photos I was travelling and had friends all around the world and amazing adventures, kissed some amazing boys, had great jobs, had lots of hobbies and interests and I realised I am a pretty great person when I look at my qualities and am loved by so many people. Today is the day I am giving up being depressed - it was tiring and not getting me anywhere.

I believe my negative thinking and bad things happening to me over the past 5 years e.g breaks up, friends hurting me, regrets etc.. has slowly be chipping at my self esteem to the point where it crippled me.

It's okay to feel like a piece of shit sometimes and do nothing but sulk in sadness. It's okay if you have broken another promise to complete all your incomplete books this time. It's okay if you are an artist and haven't created a masterpiece in days. It's okay if you are a working professional and you don't feel like working today. Don't force yourself to be creative or productive.

Whenever you get this feeling that you are being unproductive, it's just a sign that you should stop worrying and lay down for a while.

Why don't you make a cup of tea for your entire family and chat with them sitting in the balcony just like old times? Sneak into the kitchen while your mom is making your favourite dish and crack some of your lame jokes to make her laugh. Sit with your Dad sometimes and tell him the time when he taught you to ride the bicycle is still one of the best memories of your life.

If the home doesn't feel like home for you, it's okay. Step outside on your terrace, look at the sky and add your favourite songs in the playlist you have been making for a long time.

Call the friend from school who made you smile on your first day there, tell him/her sorry for the lack of communication and that you are grateful for their friendship.

Trust me, these little things will give you that feeling of wholesomeness which isn't less productive than all the things your friends are doing. Everyone is doing something or the other which makes them happy. If sleeping an extra hour makes you happy, that counts as a productive thing, too. Don't compare your happiness with others. Your mental peace is above everything else.

Stay home, be lazy and even if you are doing nothing, trust me, it's the best productive thing you can do right

2019-03-13 02:07:18,"My referral got rejected due to lack of funding by the NHS. I'm angry, confused and just want a rant.",,"So I'm gonna start of this with a warning, I am terrible at English and typing in general so if I waffle on and some of it doesn't make sense then sorry.

So let's start with my story.

I've always struggled with paying attention, keeping focus and keeping myself motivated but didn't really think much of it, I just thought that was me but it started to affect my job and my relationship. 

I work in sales so keeping focus is key and I've had a few complaints with me looking over customers shoulder because something else had happened or my brain just went on its own little journey and with my girlfriend consistently got annoyed with me because I forgot to do the simple tasks she asked me to do and losing focus when she talks to me I realised there might be something more to this.

So I wanted to check if there was an underlying thing why this is all happening so I made an appointment with my GP. I went, described everything and the next thing I know she shows me a screen with some notes from 2004, suspected ADHD! so my parents knew and didn't tell me, So I rang them and asked what happened, they rejected the drug they got recommended and never told me about anything ( I would like to say that they meant good by this, they didn't want the drug to affect who I was and my personality, even though their logic is flawed by not telling me they have given me every opportunity to have a fantastic life and I wouldn't be who I am and in my amazing job without them, it still would have been good to know though). So I asked the doctor what the next step was and she said that the only way to get medicated as an adult is by seeing a psychiatrist and get prescribed by her as there isn't any licensed ADHD medication for adults in the UK. So she sent off the refferel and said wait two weeks to hear back.

A month passes and I hear nothing so I ring and ask what happened, turns out my referral was rejected not because I don't need it and they don't think it would help me but because they can't FUND it. I'm stuck.

yes, I am doing well in my job but there's so much more I could be doing. I have days where I want to start doing more on the side. I hype myself up to start reading books I've been wanting to read for ages but lose all motivation to do so. I want to do more with my life but I struggle so much and I always slip back into laziness.

I feel angry, scared and worried that I'm not going to make anything of myself because I'm not getting the help I think I need.

Am I overthinking everything? has anyone else experienced this in the UK? What should I do? Or should I just stop being stupid and get on with it? I just don't know and to be frankly honest I'm scared. I just don't want to fail. I feel like I can't focus right now and this whole not getting help thing is going to knock me back 20 steps.

TLDR: Doctor thinks I need help but the NHS can't fund to help me right now. I'm scared and think this is going to stop me moving forward in life and limit my potential as a human.",False,4,0,3,0,0,adhd

I recently was diagnosed with ADHD at age 32, and lately I've been wondering about impulsivity when it comes to sexuality. I've identified as demisexual for several years now and I don't particularly find arousal in what they call ""vanilla"" activities. Mainly because it's too boring for me.

However, I've been into leather, rubber, uniforms and general BDSM ever since I could remember but with the impulsivity, I'm noticing that I'll get these strong desires for leather play, pornography, and even engaging in self bondage. Granted, I do have a loving partner who is accepting to all of that, but has anyone in this group had issues where the impulses to buy fetish gear or engage in activity been more frequent with your ADHD? 

And has having been on medication helped at curbing those urges? I don't see fetish as a problem in general, if anything it's more of an expression of self. It's possible that because I'm not living with my partner yet, that there's a lot of dissatisfaction in desires unfulfilled, but still I wonder if the urges are amplified because of my ADHD.",False,3,0,5,0,0,adhd

*TL;DR New bosses don't like me and it's ruining my chance of progress. No one at work knows about my ADHD, what do I do?*

As with many on here I've managed to lead a fairly successful life in spite of my condition, but recently things have changed.

At work I've always managed to keep it together by surrounding myself with people who fill in the gaps for me and can help to articulate my thoughts and feedback better than I can personally. I'm now finding myself more in contact with senior management, so I'm more exposed and don't feel equipped to deal with live conversations.

Our company recently acquired another business and their CEO has been made chief of my section and several of his previous senior managers have been placed directly beneath him.

It turns out a few have taken issue with my appearance (beard, wear uard rock tshirts and ripped Jeans but it's a casual office and never been an issue before), but moreso they have an issue with my personality as I'm direct, tend to go on what appears to be a rambly rant, can't articulate my points and seen as ""belligerent"".

The problem for me is those are all traits of my ADHD, I'm direct and inarticulate because I forget my point half way through speaking so I keep talking until I remember it again, so it's a coping mechanism, I also have volume issues and find it hard to regulate my emotions. 

It's really getting me down as my capability is not in question and I'm very good at my job but my communication skills and emotions are letting the side down.

I was hoping to apply for a promotion but another section head and another senior manager (ones who provided me the feedback from other managers off the record) both of whom I have good relationships with, have pretty much said it's an uphill task and minds are already made up but they're backing me.

No one knows about my condition, not even HR, I was only diagnosed after I joined and I've also not had access to meds or a pyshciatrist for about three years due to poor mental health services.

I've never used my ADHD as an excuse but it's genuinely an issue in this instance. It feels like I'm being discriminated against but they aren't aware of my ADHD so I'm not, right? 

So I suppose my long-winded question is, what the fuck do I do?",1579149868.0,3,0,2,0,0,adhd

2019-03-12 06:54:19,My current thoughts about ADHD typed out as I procrastinate sleeping (I hope this is the right place to post this),,"Ok so it’s like past midnight right now, I’m supposed to take the ACT today. I couldn’t fall asleep so I started watching YouTube and eventually ended up reading articles about other people and their life experiences with ADHD. Now that the background is over, here is my rant. 

Whenever I read those articles I saw many stories about people who got diagnosed in adulthood or late teens. I am not one of those people, I was diagnosed in 1st grade and medicated ever since. Back in kindergarten my teacher though I was actually mentally retarded. Luckily my first grade teacher, an amazing person, realized I wasn’t retarded, I was just bored. The moment I got medicated my life got so much better. At the end of my 1st grade year I got tested for gifted classes and by 2nd grade I was in gifted classes. Pre-medication I used to take an eternity to do my math work because I found it boring. Now that I’m medicated, I love math and can solve math problems in seconds with and without meds. In kindergarten I ended up learning how to write almost immediately, got bored with how they taught me to write, and taught myself my own way. (Now I do weird things like start my eights in the center) 

Once I got medicated my gifted side my able to shine and I soared. Around the middle of second grade I moved to the town I’ve lived in since then, I remember in third grade my classmates used to call me “the new Einstein.”

I’m grateful for my medication, and I wouldn’t want to go through life without it. I’m able to focus and get stuff done, like how I’m currently my school’s Junior Class President. I love being gifted, but I also love being ADHD, both are common with thinking differently so I end up seeing all kinds of connections other people don’t notice. However, sometimes I feel like my meds almost completely hide my ADHD rather then help control it. 

Now, ever since like elementary school I’ve been the type of person to keep my problems to myself and not bother others with them, which is fine because I’m almost always able to solve my issues by myself. So that along with the meds means that most people at school never realize that I’m even ADHD. The amount of times a teacher had a look of complete shock after the found out I have ADHD is too many to count. So it’s very obvious to me that while I know that even with meds my ADHD is present to me, it is almost never present to others. 

When I’m not on my meds or when the wear off later is the evening though, it is very obvious to everyone around me that I’m ADHD. As a result it feels like medicated me seems like a completely different person than non-medicated me. Like I’m living a double-life of some sort. And sometimes it even feels like I’m lying to everyone by showing them this “fake me.” 

For example, as I mentioned previously I’m my school’s Junior Class President. As a result I go to a lot of Student Council conventions and workshops with other members of my student council. At the most recent one we went to, after the activities for that day were over, all of the students (they were only 9 of us) were in a hotel room together playing games late into the night. We had started playing cards against humanity and I was laughing my ass off at every little thing (though I usually do that when tired), I was also fidgety and sporadic. I had this giant smile on my face, cause it felt like I was actually showing them who I really was. I could see how they really felt though, some confused, some annoyed, some not knowing what to feel, one even subtly laughing as if I was a toddler saying the dumbest things in the world (and they’re in a grade below me!). 

I know that part of this is all in my head, and it’s adolescences and all that Jazz. But to some extent it does feel like I’m some kind of fake, like I’m wearing a mask to cover up the real me. 



Welp, that was all my thoughts at the moment typed out into some type of hopefully understandable thing. Has anyone else felt similar?

2020-02-13 03:48:18,I spend a lot more time on my computer looking for motivation/a plan than I do actually getting things done.,Questions/Advice/Support,"Like right now.

&#x200B;

I, like most people, can focus better when my house is clean and my to-do list is short and simple. This doesn't happen often, and it doesn't last long. If I've been putting off a phone call or errand, or my floors need to be swept, or my computer folders need to be organized/decluttered, I can't think straight. I can't focus on my classes or relationships or interests/hobbies. I can't even do basic things like brush my teeth and take a shower. Instead, I do absolutely nothing but waste time until my house is a disaster and that to-do list gets overwhelmingly long.

*OR*

I spend all my free time trying to organize my life. I make all these lists and try to create routines (on paper), but I never get around to implementing any of it. I download apps that are supposed to help me form good habits or be more productive, but I ignore all the notifications or forget about them completely. I create a meal plan for the week and go shopping, then I eat out anyway. I spend hours reading about time management and self-discipline and maintaining balance, but none of it actually helps me. In fact, all this planning and organization makes things a little worse. I get overwhelmed when I have too many lists and plans floating around (which is more of my anxiety taking over than my ADHD).

It's a bit of a cycle because with physical and mental clutter I can't focus, but I need to focus to rid myself of the clutter. It's also discouraging because I feel like when I fix one thing in my life, another issue comes and stresses me out so I can't do what I need to do. It's also just plain exhausting because there is no finish line. For example, my house can be cleaned but it can't stay that way. I may get caught up on stuff, but I'm never *really* caught up. I'm not really sure what to do. Has anyone found a way out of this mindset?",1581566036.0,101,0,27,0,0,adhd

2020-05-24 14:18:08,I have a social anxiety problem that peaks when I’m with my own people,Needs A Hug/Support,"Long story short, I was bullied as a little child. And I don’t think a day goes by where my now 18 yr old self doesn’t have some sort of emotional flashback. I’m black, and went to a black school. The problem is less so the women, mainly black males. I got bullied for being very feminine and I was from Africa, so they made fun of me and accused me of having Ebola(2014-2015) and other things. It was very humiliating and I didn’t realize how much it would hurt me years later. 

Now if I simply hear a hetero black man’s voice in the distance, or comes close, my anxiety peaks to a high. My anxiety is for everyone but worse for people who resemble me. I can’t help it, but whenever I hear a group of men laughing my brain goes back to years ago, and I’m praying they aren’t laughing at me. So I do my best to leave and avoid that situation. Including not getting close to any straight black man, or any man, out of fear of rejection or hate. 

And as someone who does customer service at fast food, it’s exhausting and the feeling never lets up. End of my rope.

2020-04-01 10:53:58,Fired from my 3rd job in 3 years. Feeling quite crappy.,Rant/Vent,"First time poster here. Would firstly like to acknowledge the shoulder that this forum has been over the past few hours. Thanks a lot you all, it makes me feel less alone when I know there are people who have been in the same boat as I am now, and eventually found some job to stick to, as hopeless as I feel about the whole situation right now. 

I have been an 'achiever' in any sense of the word throughout my life, making it to my country's best universities. I had strong academic support during school from my parents in subjects I would have I otherwise failed in, and lots of moral support through my undergrad and MBA days from friends and my significant other, who moved states to be with me for jobs which we thought would work out for me. Was fired from all these jobs (2017, 2018, 2020), and the guilt is killing me. 

I am an introvert to the extreme, and have battled social anxiety and panic disorder for most of my adult life. 

 I have always ALWAYS felt like an impostor at all these jobs. Even though I'm highly qualified for them. I struggle with focus, procrastination, and motivation. I can get some stuff done in 3 hours, but would have been running away from it for about 3 weeks or longer. I am not proud of these aspects, and feel terrible about myself. 

My pattern with work has been like this - I enter the role with some measure of confidence, leaving my comfort zones far behind. I took up client facing roles. Being a management consultant, that's sort of table stakes, so I try to push myself. 

I begin to make mistakes. Regardless of how MUCH I checked the outgoing documents. Or analyses. These mistakes spiral into bigger mistakes. Entire projects had to be reassigned because they lost faith in my abilities to take instructions, to be proactive, to be thorough, to manage the work done by the team under me and make it error free. I have beaten myself beyond words to set these things right, but it still evades me.

My latest job loss happened after my manager felt the need to micromanage my efforts owing to my mistakes. Things just went out of control after that, and no amount of effort on my part could salvage my image at the firm. He ensured to enlist all the project managers on his side, to reaffirm their lack of faith in my abilities. They put me on a so-called performance improvement plan after assigning me the lowest possible rating, but had probably decided to fire me regardless of the outcome, judging by their deaf ear. 

I have restarted the happy drugs and sleepy drugs on my psychiatrist's advice for the time being, but she wants me to get evaluated for possible ADHD, and says that the depression, anxiety and panic are mostly a result of the ADHD itself, but wants to run some tests to be sure. 

I feel really, REALLY crappy. Why can't I hold a job like the rest of my peers? Everyone has some issues or the other, and I feel I don't deserve any leeway from life to cope with something as mundane as a JOB, something that am failing at despite looking at it as mundane.

2020-06-21 02:39:49,Am I being unreasonable?,,"So, I don't make posts that often on reddit, but I find myself wondering what to do in this situation. Not even sure if this is the subreddit I should post on, but will try it here anyhow. I have clinical depression and extreme anxiety, which is/was fairly controlled.

Around Aug '19 a friend (known him for 8 years) needed a place to stay, I offered my place (as I have 3 spare bedrooms, no big deal, don't really need a roommate but  wouldn't mind the extra $$ for bills). Little did I realize what I was getting myself into, but maybe I'm looking at this wrong. As I've said, I've known him for 8 years, but I nor any of his other friends knew about his severe depression. If he runs into something that ""bothers him"" (stresses him out) he will literally go sleep for 20 - 32 hrs. This happens multiple times a week.

Before COVID (when we all weren't working from home), he was late every day to his work, constantly called out because ""just don't feel like going in"", constantly complains about how his life is going no where, etc. Now that we're all working from home, he's still late to work, because he can't wake up, etc. He doesn't take showers, he can't take out the garbage, can't wash his dishes, doesn't clean his room / bathroom, doesn't take care of himself (as he's clearly depressed).

Him being a friend and me knowing how this all goes. I attempted to talk to him about his job, he claims he has wanted to get in my industry, so I bought him a few good books to help and tried to show him the basics. Of which he hasn't even attempted to read a single book. I've attempted to talk to him about getting professional help, which he keeps stating he needs to, but then never makes an effort. There's always some excuse, ""oh, I can't get anyone on the phone"" (which is a lie, we have the same Dr's office), ""oh, they won't call me back"" (again, lie), etc. 

Now, normally, I wouldn't attempt to intervene so much in someone's affairs, even a friend, unless they asked. However, lately (2-3 mo) I've noticed his depression has been wearing off on myself and even my dog. My dog tries to bring him toys and what not and he just shoo's him away, then my dog will mop on the couch for days, until said roommate actually tries to play with him. I've noticed I've become increasingly falling back into a depression for no reason that I can determine. 

I brought this up to my psychiatrist, whom said it was possible for people, especially friends/roommates to project depression on to other people. Of course he recommended I talk to him, which I did, more than several times.

Personally I can't afford (mentally) to fall into a bad depression state again, but my roommate just feels like a weight and since we're both working from home, it's unavoidable at the moment.

Since I've talked to him several times,  attempted to get him help, attempted to get into another profession, attempt to do things to help the guy out all the time. Am I being unreasonable if I ask him to move out at the end of the year if he can't get things in order?

2020-07-02 03:28:16,Just a message for anyone who feels lost in their life right now,:chat: Just Chatting,"Hey guys,

I'm not 100% sure this is appropriate for this subreddit. But, here goes!

If you're struggling right now in any way, this is a message for you. If you feel like you're lost in your life right now because you're not where you want to be - or you are looking at your friends/ family who are buying houses, starting families, landing jobs in their career field, or getting their college degree - don't put yourself down.

Everyone's journey in life is different. You are not unsuccessful, or a disappointment, because you haven't gotten to those places yet or accomplished those things. Life is not a race - don't be in a rush to get to the finish.

If you're not sure what career you want to do, or where you want to go in life, that's OK, bro. I like to imagine life as a staircase - take things one step at a time until you reach your goal. And even if you don't have definitive goals right now, make it a goal to do/ be better than you did yesterday. 

Finally, take a deep breath, think about your life, and look how far you've come. If no one has told you that they're proud of you - I will, bro. You're doing awesome, don't sweat that you're not sure where to go yet, and take things one step at a time. Do better than yesterday.

(I was inspired to write this post because of a lot of my friends who have felt this way).

Have a good day, bros.

Edit: Alright, bros. I've commented on as many posts as I can! I am super sleepy now. Thank you to all of the users that gave awards to the post. Goodnight brothers and sisters! 🙂

Edit2: Guys, on a serious note, if you're on the brink of taking your life, or have been thinking about it, please reach out to a loved one or a professional for help. Your life is valuable and important, even to me an internet stranger. Please, if you ever think about suicide, please visit these sites.

I’ve been taking Concerta for about 4 weeks now and have noticed no difference whatsoever. It’s not just that my focus has not improved; I haven’t even experienced any kind of “high” or crash or whatever. Maybe just a bit of dry mouth.

I talked to my psychiatrist about it expecting him to recommend another kind of medication, as I’ve read that it usually takes a while to find the right type of medication. Instead he said that it was pointless to try any other kind of medication because Concerta was the best on the market.

He said that I should get psychotherapy/psychoeducation or whatever and that’s just not an option that’s available to me right now what with Covid and the economic collapse that my country is facing, and honestly I don’t think it would benefit me.

I’m honestly so distraught right now I started crying. I was so relieved when I got diagnosed because I thought I would start to feel better and I’ve been reading so many of your posts here expressing how happy you felt after starting your medication.

2020-05-17 19:34:57,What has happened in your life that has made you depressed?,,"This might be a bit personal for some but I was wondering what events has happened in your life that has made you depressed?  I understand depression isn't just a feeling but a mental disorder as well but I feel the two go hand in hand.  Overwhelming depression an anxiety eventually leads to the disorder.  It's not something that goes away easily after it has infected your brain.    


For me personally it's been a lot of things.  I grew up in a pretty shitty household.  My parents didn't seem to give a shit about me and still don't.  They loved my sister but I always just felt like a burden more than anything.  They seemed to always look at me like a failure where as my sister became somewhat successful in life.  I was also bullied a lot growing up and even into my adult hood.  It wasn't until my late 20s when I finally started growing a spine.  I've also had trust and abandonment issues my whole life as well.  So many of my so called former friends either betrayed me or abandoned me when I needed them the most (especially when depression started sinking it's teeth into me).  I've never felt loved or wanted at all in my life.  Even the girlfriends in my life didn't really seem to give a shit about me.  It felt like I was just a mere toy for them to play with until they got bored and moved on.

The world in general makes me depressed though.  The way we treat each other, how cold and callous everyone is and just the lack of empathy so many people have just irks me all of the wrong ways.  No one seems to give a shit about anyone but themselves and it makes me upset.  The only way to succeed in life it seems is to be ruthless, cold and callous and I've never had it in me to be those things.    

A lot of this stuff has actually made me a stronger person in the long run believe it or not but it changed me.  I used to be the kind of guy that would wear his heart on his sleeve but now I keep it behind lock and key (I didn't mean for that to rhyme I swear lol).  People hated me because I was too nice and now people hate me because I'm not nice enough.  It's a never ending cycle.  I have one friend in my life and he's the only one that seems to give a shit although my trust issues make me doubt that most of the time.  The only thing that really keeps me going anymore is my love for music but even then that love has slowly been dying recently.  I just can't seem to be bothered with anything anymore.

2019-01-05 12:09:37,"24/7 ""Air hunger""",Advice Needed,"For at least the past 4 months (since October) I've had the constant need to take a deep breath that never seems to go away. At first I thought it was a different medical condition and because of it I went to the ER twice within the first 3 weeks and both times it was dismissed as anxiety and nothing was wrong in that sense. The first time they took an X-Ray the second time a blood test. After that I went to my family doctor to referred me to a respirologist who had also deemed there wasn't any problem and that i was getting enough oxygen

I'm posting here to ask if anyone has felt the same thing almost non-stop everyday and what treatments they used to suppress it. The most common advice I've gotten was breathing exercises which haven't seemed to work. I work out regularly so I don't think there's any heart or lung condition causing it and I'm convinced that it is anxiety

I get so panicked and feel like a failure when I just want to chill and have fun.,Discussion,"I’ve been trying really hard recently to take up some of my old pastimes again. I used to love reading, playing ukulele, drawing, playing video games. Now I get a huge feeling of anxiety creep over me when I try to get back into them.

 I think its a confidence issue? Like not feeling good enough at playing the ukulele, or not being good enough at drawing or playing games. I went to a private school where competitiveness was drummed into us. I was considered dumb because I didn’t get A* in everything and I really tied my self-worth to my abilities academically. 

Now I feel like my self-worth is tied to my pastimes. They’re meant to be the things that make me interesting as a person, I should be good at them and see progress in them. Am I even the person I think I am now that I’m too anxious to do any of these things? 

Another issue is feeling anxious that I’m possibly wasting time. I used to love sitting playing games for hours but now I feel this weight on my shoulder and pain in my chest. I feel like I should be doing something more proactive, even if I have nothing else I really need to be doing. 

I’ve started working with polymer clay because its something new and therapeutic and creative. I’ll hopefully see some progress and build up my confidence in myself, instead of feeling like I’ve lost the knack for things I used to enjoy. 

I just feel ridiculous when I take a step back and look at myself. I’m having heart palpitations just trying to relax and do something I used to enjoy. How many of you can relate?

Zoloft is not working for me anymore. I’m on the highest dose my primary doctor can give me.

 She said if I’m still anxious, then she’ll refer me to a psychiatrist so they can diagnose me and put me on a medication more specific to my needs.

I feel like I’m going insane. I try to think positively, but it’s like my brain keeps sucking me in to think negatively. I feel like I am the worst person on earth.

I don’t want to go to the psychiatrist. I’m scared to go. I hate talking about stuff. I always keep it in, so that’s probably why I’ve had a relapse. 

I literally feel anxiety on my heart. My chest feels cold, I get the feeling of “butterflies in my stomach” but in my chest. 

I was fine just a week ago. I was okay just a week ago. Why did this have to happen?! I don’t want to go through this anymore! I don’t have to be happy, I just want to feel okay. I just don’t know what to do!

2019-04-15 16:45:18,Today is just a bit much,Venting,"This horrible stomach feeling and constant worry just won't go away... Tomorrow morning I'm leaving for Berlin. It's a part of my study program this year to go there for four days. I was not nervous for it too much over the last few weeks and days but today it suddenly all hit. It's not the traveling itself that's causing the majority of my anxiety but rather the people I'm going with. I don't really fully fit into any group there. I'm on the room with my best friend at school but also with people I barely know or know to not really be my type. They all have a Whatsapp group they're in and I'm the only person on that room who isn't in it (I never asked but no one offered it either). I'm just afraid I'll have no one to chill with and have a beer at the end of the day. Or in the bus. 

But that's not the only thing that's on my mind. I also needed new shoes for this trip because I just couldn't walk any distance on my old shoes. I ordered a pair online which weren't the most perfect fit so I had to go to the store to ask for advice. Because it wasn't a straightforward return but I really had to try new shoes, I got very nervous with what to do. In the end the guy sent me to their other store to try out a size they didn't have. I did muster up the courage to ask a question I'd been needing to ask about my hiking boots which I'd been dreading since last summer so that was a win. Anyway, in the next store I was being helped by a cute girl and I felt some awkwardness between us which made the situation just really uncomfortable. I kept my cool but it was exhausting. With all the explaining I needed to do about the situation (which admittedly was very complicated) I felt like I was saying stupid or unthoughtful things and it got just way too uncomfortable. In the end it was okay and I have my new shoes but god I don't ever want to meet her again to avoid another uncomfortable situation like this one... I know it's stupid but it's how I feel...

It's still not the end though, because I also had to congratulate a friend wit her birthday over text. She is not someone whose birthday I can afford to 'forget' because I don't see her that much, we literally talked about it just last week when I ran into her, and we know each other \*literally because of our birthdays\* because they're so close together. Thing is, I never had to congratulate someone over text personally. I get really awkward texting someone personally so if possible I congratulate them in group chats or in person if I know I'll see them that day. And if neither is an option I just pretend I forgot or never knew it in the first place. I had literally been worrying about this for months in advance. Every time the thought of my birthday came up I had to think of her birthday and how I would go about congratulating her without making it seem like I barely care. I got through it, I just texted something simple and she responded with a drawn out thanks and that was it.

I wish it was just those three things because it's already bad enough but I also had to contact the customer service for my phone. Last week the charger port broke so I sent it in for repairs and this morning I get an email saying that it doesn't fall within warranty. Which I think is bullshit because the problem appeared out of nowhere. They also say the screen is broken, but that wasn't the case when I sent it away in the original box, packed within a cardboard box stuffed with old newspapers as padding? It's crazy unlikely the screen broke during transport. But I had to send some assertive emails and if there's anything I'm not it's assertive. I felt bad and stupid for saying some things and I was scared to send those mails...

I just had to let all this out.... I'm crazy nervous about everything and it's exhausting and annoying. I still need to go to the store for food for tomorrow but I really don't want to leave the house for the rest of today so I can regain some energy and motivation, and just calm down. Going to the store may not be something that gives me anxiety but it sure doesn't calm me down either. I don't know how I'm gonna get through the rest of the week if it's already this bad right now...",False,1,0,0,0,0,anxiety

1. My sleep schedule is awful. I go to bed at around 4, and am woken up by my mam between 12pm to 1pm. I'm trying to reset it by doing this. 

2. I have to clean my room. I know being in quarantine is a perfect opportunity to do this, but I'd rather spend the day with my family then cleaning, and I'm more motivated to do it at night anyway.

3. I could grind out a game or catch up on netflix. Again, would rather spend the day socialising.

4. It was in my summer holiday bucket list to try to pull an all nighter, so I figured why not do it sooner?

For anyone curious, I'm 15, in year 11 in the UK and my GCSEs (compulsory year 11 exams) have been cancelled. My school has not set year 11 any GCSE work to do as the government said we will get predicted grades, but they said after the ""Easter holidays"" they would give us easy A level work to do to help us decide our options. For anyone who doesn't know, in year 12 and 13 (17 and 18 years old) students have the option to take A levels or BTECs, in which we pick 3 subjects (sometimes more) to study for 2 years, then after you either go to a university or work.

When they start setting this work, I want to get into a healthy routine of waking up early and going to bed at a decent time. Hopefully this experiment will help.

Also, I will be catching up on sleep for the next few weeks by going to bed at around 8 to wake up at 7, giving me 11 hours each night. Then I'm sure it will adjust overtime to give me around 8 hours sleep as I go to bed later.

If anyone wants to chat about anything (especially talk to me about games, I'm planning on playing a lot tonight!) please do! I've got a while of staying awake! It's 1:48 am.

I feel like a lot of stuff I've been reading is so SPOT ON for me: impulsive, very frequent mood changes, cannot stay organized or focused, poor worker and work ethic until it's right in front of me, prefer isolation and hard to keep up relationships.

&#x200B;

In the past my relationships things always just ""never seemed to work out."" Reflecting on them, I would date a woman and I'd eventually feel like I just needed to be out of it - deep down I just needed to be alone, but I' always find some Seinfeld-esque reason to justify it (""Oh well she's xxxx""). I never really knew why I jus couldn't feel a commitment or want to be alone before.  

&#x200B;

Right now, I've been dating a girl for almost 2 years. She moved in with me this past summer. Prior to us moving in, we were good and we did long distance and FaceTime'd or spoke over the phone - which is why I think this relationship worked so well for me, because I could just hang up and be alone at the end of the day. Since she moved in - it's been tougher for me since my space is gone (her having a pet that is mean towards me does not help, and I acknowledge my dislike from this is not ADHD however!). More and more I feel like I want out, and I keep creating more justifications in my head. She is a very good woman and I feel terrible because I'm not sure I love her anymore and I don't know if it is coming from me or the ADHD.

&#x200B;

This is kind of a vent for me, but I wanted to write this and see what others thought.  As it's going right now, I want to break up with her but I don't know if this is the ADHD taking over on this.

It’s not easy for me to deal with sudden change. It just hurts really bad. My best friend just is gone. Out of my life for the foreseeable future.

2020-06-12 19:36:47,I think I am weird that I feel this way.,,"I feel that I have not been given a choice to live the life I want. I feel that I am trapped in a world ruled by the rest of the humans. I don't want to follow the rules, laws or meet the social demands created by human. I want to live by myself somewhere in nature growing my own food, with a few domestic animals and cattle, being an apiarist and with less human interaction. And most importantly with lots and lots of books. The only way I can do this I think is by earning a lot of money to buy such a place which is why I feel trapped in a fake world. 
It may sound like I want to be a farmer but not because I don't want to be doing only farming nor I want to live like a tribal man hunting animals in the forest. Just living somewhere in nature exploring my own world.

2020-01-10 10:55:27,Fear of the night time,Advice Needed,"I’ve been scared of the night for around 8 years now. It started in our old house where we’d get a lot of creepers walking around and shaking our gate for whatever reason. Our house was small and with no security so I was awake almost every night to “guard” the place (as much as a 12 yr old can lol) and I developed an ever increasing fear of the night time. There are other reasons contributing but I’m honestly too traumatized to write about them but they’ve made my fear 10x worse.

I’m not necessarily scared of the dark. I don’t like it but it doesn’t make me scared. I’m scared of the night because that’s when the bad things mostly happen and I get the worst anxiety. It’s like the chest-pounding kind where you can’t catch your breath. I’m scared to sleep at night because everyone else is asleep and there’s no one to be awake and alert us if something were to happen. So I wait until around 5 AM to settle in because everyone is getting up and I feel safe. The rest of the time is spent being scared, shaking, pacing the house, watching YT to distract myself, and such and such. I have spring semester coming up and more classes than before and I don’t want this disrupting my grades so I thought I’d ask here for some sort of advice or just comfort that I’ll be okay and reassuring words.

I’m wondering if anyone can relate to this at all. Is there something I can do to relax myself and calm my fear? Lavender oil and scented lotion hasn’t helped me so far. Watching YT videos sometimes does but sometimes it doesn’t and even then, seeing some of the things in my recommended about all the bad that’s happening in the world adds to my panic. When I went to therapy, I brought this up to her and she told me to do breathing exercises but they seem to make things worse, or maybe I’m doing them wrong but they haven’t helped so far.

My social life has been completely non-existent since I was 12, meaning I have no friends whatsoever except people to talk to at work.

I've always had the support of my family to help me through some really difficult times. My parents, my sister and my two brothers.

Now however... my siblings have kids of their own - 7 in total, I see them MAYBE once a year, I feel like I barely know my nephews/nieces. At least my sister and I talk on the phone or text to just ""catch up"". 

My brothers have gone from making me slightly annoyed to really sad and disappointed, not angry just disappointed. Usually I'm the one that calls them to talk, but after 5 minutes they make up some excuse to end the conversation. They only call me on my birthday. 

They live on the other side of the country so it's not like any of us can just go to one another over the weekend. So a few days ago my dad says ""oh btw, on Wednesday your brothers are coming to visit. 

As usual, everyone has known this for at least a month, but nobody gives a shit about me (I guess) since they're not telling me ANYTHING!

2020-06-28 04:10:55,It's been five years since some people tarnished my reputation because of my anxiety. Still dealing with the trauma it had inflicted to me.,Venting,"I always knew I have problem with anxiety since I was in high school. Although I appear calm and confident, I often get panic attack. Sometimes when my teacher calls me to recite in class, I experience it. Then, I like dancing (even if I'm bad at it) but performing in front of the crowd scares me. And socializing makes me anxious I always worry about what the other people will think of me.

Yet for whatever reason, I'm good at concealing it.

But not until when I was in 3rd year college.

We all know being a college student is difficult. And it is even harder for me because:
1. I was forced to take a degree I didn't want.
2. I'm a student leader.
3. I'm a campus journalist.
4. I'm a part-time novelist. (I'm earning money through writing. I did not come from a poor family, but I like earning money. Whatever I earned, I put it on investment.)
5. Because I was seen as responsible student, my professors (and even the dean) have a really high expectation to me, which I got no choice but to meet because of this really toxic Asian values that imposed to me.

Because of this pressure, I always wake up lethargic and stressed out. There are times that I will come to school without sleep because of anxiety.

I did not mention earlier that I have bullies in college. They are seniors who hated me because I sound too proud for them. They accuse me of being ""sipsip"" (I think the closest translation in English is buttlicker) to our professors so they will favor me. 

I am not perfect. For example, if I got so pissed off, I have tendency to shout to make them stop doing what is making me angry. These bullies did it once, during a council meeting. While I was explaining the budget plan of the year, they are interrupting me non-stop with nonsense questions and side remarks. So at the end, I shout to make them stop.

And they used that to justify bullying me. They even spread rumors of me committing embezzlement because of some missing fund. (But what actually happened is they did a transaction WITHOUT notifying me. And when I asked for the receipt of that transaction, they cannot show anything. Besides, the transaction is too questionable. It is a printed shirt that will serve us our uniform on official departmental gathering, and it is damn overpriced for that shitty quality.)

This bullying worsened my anxiety. For the first time in my life, I cannot conceal it anymore. I remember one time while I was delivering a speech, and suddenly I have panic attack. I trembled and I stuttered. It didnt help that everyone was laughing. My professor even joked that I sound like I'm a child with separation issues.

My socializing issue also worsens. I developed this tendency to feel like everyone who smiles at me are actually stabbing me from behind (which is common among Asians btw), so I became too conscious that I dont wanna be separated from my trusted friends.

This is where the problem happened. I was too dependent with them that I became annoying. I wont deny that. I really am, and if I could go back to the past, I will not seek their help and instead go to therapist right away.

But what really hurts me when these trusted friends began spreading rumors about me. I am the most dependent to this dude whom I considered a best friend. And they all think (including him) that I like this dude, and I am faking my anxiety so he will take care of me.

Upon knowing it, I began isolating myself. And it just made the matter worse. That dude even threw snide remarks at me while we were on class. He even told misleading stories to frame me as a pervert. (Example: he claims I touch his private part always. But what he never told anyone is it was my response whenever he touches my butt. Damn, he even dry humped me which really pissed me off because it is annoying!)

And I feel so hopeless back then. I cannot do anything to defend myself because no one believes me anyway. Having a small circle did not help at all. 

Thankfully, my friends in the campus paper chose to believe me because most of them have anxiety too, and they have seen my subtle traits to prove my condition.

Five years have passed since that incident happened. My anxiety still hasnt gotten better, so I end up working as a freelance writer online. It actually traumatized me and I haven't made friends with straight guys since then. I had one attempt, during a drinking session with my HS friends. They introduced a straight guy to me, and that guy is friendly. But I didn't keep it up because I'm afraid the same thing will happen again.

2019-02-05 14:40:51,How to cope with anxiety and panic due to constant intrusive thoughts?,Advice Needed,"I'm sorry to post another similar comment on this subject but I am still having immense difficulty coping with runaway generalized anxiety and daily intrusive thoughts, and I have no idea how to address it or, ideally, prevent it from damaging my emotional equilibrium even further.

As I mentioned in my last post, I have tried nearly a dozen antidepressants and anxiolytic medications, to (mostly) no avail. I have also worked with several different therapists in several different treatment modalities - CBT, DBT, etc. I was never able to develop a close enough connection to any of these therapists for me to be able to open up to them at all. At this point I am hoping to develop a reliable and effective coping mechanism I can employ myself when these waves of anxiety start to roll in from *absolutely out of nowhere*.

Possibly the most frustrating and paralyzing thing about it all is the fact that most of the time these anxiety attacks seem to come from out of nowhere and focused on nothing in particular, aside from this massive swirling whirlwind of panic and dread - like that horrible sinking feeling you get when you suddenly realize you've forgotten something critical, like leaving the stove burners on or forgetting a term paper that's due in several hours. Except there's nothing at the center of it all, so there is nothing I can do proactively to resolve the source of the anxiety. I have at least 5-10 incidents a day of these intrusive thoughts (maybe a more accurate term would be ""intrusive feelings""), sometimes many more, and sometimes it's more or less 24/7.

My brain is honestly so scrambled from lack of sleep and constant worry that I feel I'm not adequately conveying just how agonizing this all really is, but I assure you it is truly a daily hell for me. How can I train my mind to withstand these mental intrusions, or to ""ground"" myself in a way that helps return me to the present moment and prevents me from getting sucked down into the morass of all this directionless fear and panic?",1549378026.0,15,0,15,0,0,anxiety

This has frustrated my family to no end, as it should, so I decided to sit down with my mom to figure out how we could work together to solve that. That conversation didn’t go well. I suggested she put together a list of things she needs me to do and what days she needs them on. She insisted this wasn’t necessary and that I should just do things when she tells me to. I’ve tried to explain again and again why that doesn’t work well, but she doesn’t seem to care, she thinks if I want a list so bad I should just do it myself.

I’ve tried to do it myself, but the problem is what she wants done and when she wants it is completely random. Whether I have a list or not she does the same thing of deciding she needs something done and nagging me sometimes for hours until it gets done. How that’s easier than making a list I may never know.

This has been a battle for a few months and that brings us to today. I got into it with my sister because she kept asking why I didn’t just do it, so I told her. I told her about how hard it was to break out of things and do those tasks, even if they’re not difficult. She claimed she understood but said it’s my problem and that I’m a privileged jerk.

Now it is 2019 and I am in the states yet again, but as a college student. Skittles changed over all those years.

2020-06-30 04:20:11,I have eaten less than 1000 calories six of the last seven days and I don't plan to stop.,,"TL;DR A series of shitty life events culminated in the guy I have feelings for telling me I am too fat to date, which led to me completely losing my appetite. 

Throwaway because people related to or knowledgeable about the story know my usual account. Sorry that this is a long one, but I've wanted to get it off my chest. 

I have had a rough couple of weeks that included losing my job, getting sick to the point of self-quaranting on doctor's orders (fortunately it turned out not to be Covid), and having a very difficult time signing up for unemployment due to somewhat recent changes in my legal documentation. 

All of that was enough to leave me frustrated and depressed, but the straw that broke the camel's back came a week ago when I decided to try and talk about my feelings with a guy I had fallen for, which, as you may imagine given where I'm posting, did not go well. 

The guy in question and I had a multiyear, somewhat long-distance FWB relationship, but I had begun to believe that we were developing a deeper connection. We had gone on several dates without ever talking about the changing nature of the relationship and he was comfortable participating in and initiating things like handholding, kissing in public, cuddling, etc.

We also shared a strong bond related to our interests, passions, and beliefs, as well as supported one another through difficult life events. All of these factors and more led to me ""catching feelings"", as the kids say. 

Looking back there were warning signs that he was not reciprocating in the caught feelings department, but it was easy for me to focus on the positive elements of our relationship because they made me happy. I say this to illustrate my own failings to recognize reality and own my part of this dumpster fire.

Cut to last week. I had decided finally to have a conversation with him about the nature of our relationship and I hoped to confess my feelings for him.

I was so nervous that I didn't think to tell him beforehand that I wanted to talk and I ended up catching him off guard, which was totally my fault. He was also a tad impaired as we were relaxing while I worked up the courage to talk to him, but before we got into our talk he assured me he was cognizant enough for our conversation. 

He ended up agreeing that he felt a deeper connection than just FWBs, but he wasn't interested in a romantic relationship. When I asked why not, that's when he told me it was because I was out of shape. Like, no hesitation, just laid it out there. 

He immediately tried to apologize, but my mind went blank and after some more awkward comments I got out of there as fast as I could. 

It didn't hit me until after that if he wasn't attracted to me then why was he still ok with fooling around? It made me feel cheap and worthless and ugly. 

That one comment, combined with my already low self esteem and body issues, was enough to break something in me. Food doesn't taste good, I have no appetite, and whenever I think of eating I can hear that phrase ringing in my ears: out of shape. Fat. 

The twisted thing is just a short time before I met him, I'd used calorie counting to drop 90lbs and was quite skinny. Depression eating and later covid contributed to me gaining about 60lbs of it back. 

I didn't eat anything the first day after going to see him. The second I ate a sandwich. The third day I tried to put more effort in and managed to eat about 500 calories in two meals. The only exception was a day I visited my mom, where I ate a roughly 1500 calorie meal my stepdad made, because I didn't want to worry her. I felt nauseous afterwards. 

Now I'm torn, because what started as apathy and depression is resulting in rapid weightloss. I know it's only been a week and maybe not eating much in such a short time isn't a big deal, but I'm already down 10lbs since visiting him. I also know it's unhealthy, but, aside from my bestie, the only thing that has made me feel better this week is seeing the numbers on the scale dropping. 

And so far I feel fine, so maybe it's ok?",False,2,0,5,0,0,depression
2019-11-30 00:06:28,Advice on how to focus without getting derailed every 5 minutes? Also looking for advice in general!,Questions/Advice/Support,"Hi, I'm a university student (20f) being tested for ADHD and I was supposed to make an appointment to go for a checkup next week to be evaluated again and possibly get a prescription but forgot to book the appointment.

The thing is my final exams start on Wednesday (the 4th) and I'm finding it **really** hard to study without getting distracted by random things every 5 minutes pretty much (writing this now I'm actually being distracted from studying but I thought this would be useful to help). Also, I can't make an appointment now until the 10th and by then 3/5 of my exams will be done so getting treatment is kinda out the window until next semester. 

My question is how have you found a way to focus and concentrate before medication or what have you found helpful? I really love to talk when I study because I'll remember the conversation about what I studied but unfortunately no one around me does :/

Also, I'm hesitant about taking meds and wondering what people's experiences with them are. How did you feel when you first started, common side effects, etc? And if you don't mind sharing what do you take and how does it work for you (I'm aware of Concerta, Ritalin, and Vyvanse).

How did you find out you had ADHD? How did you feel? What do you normally experience? I never knew ADHD existed until my first year of university and always thought my mind was normal but struggled a lot more than my friends and never understood how they could just sit down and study for hours. Comparing what my friends with and without ADHD go through I do relate a lot more to my friends with ADHD. I feel kinda lost because I feel like I do have ADHD and fit the criteria, but I'm still uncertain because I've been told by my doctor I don't typically act like a person with ADHD that they normally see (I'm not interrupting them or wandering around the office) and they don't want to deny me treatment if I have ADHD but also don't want to treat me if I do have it. This makes me question myself if I actually have ADHD and I really don't know what to do.

I still haven't accomplished what I want. Things got quieter/calmer, got plenty of time to meditate on the issues, but in no way got better.

--> My parents needed help, so I went back at their home since a few years (multi-family home). 

They're getting old, they're alone and they're starting to have health issues. I planned my whole life to move away and fulfill my dreams in another country where my friends are, visa planned and everything.
Now I am fucked.  
Lost friends, no gf, dropped uni (medicine), no job, have no time to improve i.e. no e-learning.  
I'm doing all the chores a big farmhouse needs. Think huge land, think huge house, think not enough money to be on autopilot... as I'm not a millionaire it's hell. On top of that, there's pretty much everything to fix, from house stuff to land/lawn/tools/machinery. Add that's in the middle of nowhere.  
My time is fragmented, there's always something to do at the worst time.

I am at home, I could enjoy it but I don't feel at home. It's a weird feeling.  

So much going in my head that I lost the tranquility I'd need to start a project/online job/course and stick to it.
My brain is constantly crashing either by the long to-do lists/stuff to fix/chores or frequently clashing against my ""wannabe life"".
Every time I think about my wannabe life things just get worse as I get bad-tempered quite easily. Maybe this is why I prefer to be alone most of the time, no matter how much harder the job will be.
Hate the place, I've lost the old friends I had here as I lived elsewhere for the last 15 years. Now many either moved or have families.  
Hate the dullness/monotony of a small town in the middle of nowhere.
I have literally every object I could desire. I'm living in a beautiful house, but I am so sad you couldn't believe it. I'm doing it day by day, but I'm swearing like a sailor...
Do you know that feeling when you realize you own every object you thought you really wanted, yet you aren't enjoying it as they don't really make you happy or you aren't happy to enjoy them? Multiply it by ~1000.  

I've literally put my life on hold, for a while. I am right now not able to steer it in the direction I'd like.  

I've got no big money, no gf, no hobbies.  
My friends now are all doctors, lawyers, realtors, and such, living the high life 100k plus.  
Sometimes I hear them complaining of such small things like they were huge issues, ""first-world problems"". Fuck, they should try what I am experiencing daily. It makes me mad, and that's why I don't even reach them anymore.
  
I should leave the country and enjoy life, but I think it as too selfish now that my parents need help.
So I'm stuck in a tunnel I can't find a way out. My brain screams run away, my heart says you cannot do it. And this happens every day from the moment I wake up.  

No absolutely any kind of job opening available in quite a distant radius, now with covid is even worse than ever.
I'm doing some small jobs online just to get some money and not to completely burn my emergency fund, as I don't want to live completely off my parents' money.

But it's hard. It's mentally hard to keep track of all of this. I think I've reached the bottom of emotions, really I feel can't go any lower. 

I've been so accustomed to this situation that I am becoming emotionless. 
I'm not going out anymore as I feel I have nothing to say and I'll get bored quickly. 
You know when you talk with friends about life progress/work/marriage/kids that kind of talks...

I'm not self-harming or into drugs or anything, I discovered through these difficult times that I'm stronger than I thought. 
I kinda know that I've reached what's my lower level of emotions and I'm bouncing on it. It's a good robust support.
But it's still hard and weird when everyone in the room is happy and you are the only one not smiling. And this happens in every room...

Out of nowhere this old man yanks the door open and grabs me and tries to pull me out while yelling ""Get out you thief"". I manage to pull the door closed and lock it, and he continues to scream at me and make a scene, then called the police. For whatever reason he thought I broke into the car, and told the police that. The police come within 5 minutes or so, and while we waited the man continued to yell at me and somehow got bystanders to say they witnessed me break in the car, even though I never even got out of the car when we pulled up. The police got there, guns drawn, handcuffed me and were about to take me to the police station when my fiance came out of the book store and told them it's her car and this man is either senile and confused, or he is just being a dick and thought someone as young as me doesn't belong in a car this nice.

2019-09-23 08:45:50,Is It Possible to be Diagnosed in Adult Life? (more questions),Questions/Advice/Support,"Okay so I genuinely believe I have ADHD. I always remember joking when I was in elementary, middle and early high school I had ADHD because I could never focus and always had to be moving (basic shit) but never really took it serious. I’m in my senior gonna turn 18 on the 30th if October. 

So I’m in therapy for depression and anxiety and I have been talking to my therapist that I can hardly focus (been going on for the past two-three years) and I was telling her how I literally lose my train of thought always, I bounce back and forth always (if you have a 10 second long convo with me it becomes very clear I can’t have a convo without going back and forth or losing my train of thought) and I always have to be moving. 

So she told me she thinks I have ADHD. I have a meeting with her Thursday where she’s gonna do a test. I looked at the symptoms online and I have nearly all of them besides being aggressive. But in a way I can be very aggressive if I’m passionate about something or someone really upsets me big time. 

I guess I didn’t even know I had the possibility of it because my grades were always good but now I’m realizing g I actually had a hard time focusing while in class and such. 

There are many other incidents. I have such a hard time focusing on shit that I will literally be thinking about stuff while cooking and put the carton of almond milk in the fridge and butter and shit in the cabinets and cereal in the fridge (all real examples sadly) and I won’t even realize it until my mom comes into my room and is like “Wtf [my name] why did you put these things where they don’t go” but the thing is I don’t remember putting those things there. 

Oh another example is that I literally can’t sleep because I can’t do something as simple as focusing on sleeping lmao. 

I mainly think my therapist and I are connecting that my anxiety and depression comes from the potential of ADHD 

Or maybe I’m super mental and it’s all in my head lmao. Maybe I’m just a mess. Oh well I guess I will update when I get answers",1569226518.0,5,0,8,0,0,adhd

2019-05-16 13:08:38,It's Time for Medication...ASAP,Rant/Vent,"23 F diagnosed with ADHD pi last year. I have a full-time job and a part-time lifeguarding gig at the Y. I woke up this morning feeling like I was sleeping too long, looked at my phone, and see two unread messages from my co-worker and my manager at the Y reminding me that I was supposed to come in this morning to open the pool. I immediately started sobbing, because not only did I know I was supposed to work this morning, I also made sure my alarm was set before I went to bed. But I set THE WRONG ALARM. No bells went off as I stared at the 7:30am alarm, when it was the 4:30am alarm I needed to check. And not only did I not show up, but this is my THIRD no-call no -show at this job and I started in the Fall.

The first time, I said it wouldn't happen again and I had honestly forgotten that I was on. The second time I apologized since I had talked to my manager about getting out 15 minutes early for that shift two weeks prior since it conflicted with my full-time position (here I was looking ahead and being good only to altogether blank the day before and convince myself I didn't have work the next day). Then, I spent some time leaving him a voicemail about how I had to work the overnight at my other job since there was no coverage and so I'd either be late or not able to show up to my morning shift, to which he reminded me that I WAS NOT EVEN SCHEDULED.

At this point, I asked to meet with my manager in person and have a talk. I was going to tell him about my ADHD and try to brainstorm together what some helpful accommodations would be. Since we didn't plan a meeting in our text convo, I brought the subject up of meeting to him when I saw him next (we had already texted about it) and he kind of gave a spiel and didn't sit down with me. I didn't tell him I had ADHD since we were literally on the pool deck in front of everyone and he seemed like he had to go run off somewhere. He did mention that my behavior hasn't bothered him so much because  I am ""conscientious and seem to care"".

But now my manager wants a real sit down talk. He said he's not going to terminate me, which is amazing. I need this job, but I'm proving to myself that I am unable to meet the basic expectations of employment. I feel so ashamed and it's going to be really difficult showing my face at my next shift. My coworkers probably think I'm awful. I have left them high and dry so many times and I am constantly 2-3 minutes late to my lessons. I was sobbing for 20 minutes just completely frustrated with the way my brain works.

In between the second and the third time, I went off my Lexapro 20mg cold turkey and have been feeling so much better: way more motivated and productive, higher highs (some extreme lows, but I'm in a place where I have been able to get myself out of them). That has been a plus and I thought things were turning around, but I think it's clear that I cannot be successful without finding a concrete way to manage my ADHD. So....therefore....meds. I'm going to try and get into my PP today. He's the one that diagnosed me, but I moved from the area and haven't been doing regular check-ins.

Seriously wish me luck.

Edit: Just secured an appt with my PP for 11am today.

I don’t have the strength to do even simple everyday tasks.

I feel lonely. I feel separate from my family, like I don’t belong. I haven’t saw my real mother in years and my father couldn’t look after me, so I have lived with a foster family for the majority of my childhood.

I don’t feel comfortable at all around my foster family and get anxiety around them. I’m really quiet around them - only speaking when spoken to, and giving short answers at that. In fact, I’m so anxious around them that they could be having a conversation around me and I’ll just be sitting there, pretending I don’t exist. 

So, I don’t feel like I have any real figure in my life who I can talk to about my depression.

As a result of this overbearing situation, and the fact that I’ve been living through this nightmare for years and years, makes me feel so helpless. I don’t have the strength to do anything about this, other than wait until I can move out. 

It’s so bad that I hide in my room all day. This results in frustration as I can’t eat or drink anything until I can safely get something to eat when no one will see me.

This behaviour is so strange, I hate myself for being this way. But it’s almost as if my environment growing up somehow cultivated me to be this way.

2020-06-10 01:54:01,When will it end? i Just want to feel normal.,,"21M here. Ever since i could i remember i was bullied at school and beaten at home by my older brothers sure some could say thats just family but when you get cut with a knife at 13 and have to go the hospital then is it still them just doing what siblings do? I've never had the chance to show people what i could really do because i always choke. My parents would always let me know how much of a disappointment and embarrassment i was to them whenever i messed up. Even to this day my dad still believes i'm the stupid kid who took weeks to learn multiplication and division when the other school kids got it in no time. My mom still believes that my depression isn't real and that my problems aren't as serious as hers. I never had confidence in myself because i was always put down. My dad would always scream at me, ""come on have some confidence. Like geez guy come on you're a guy and you break down when someone is looking at you."" I was always so terrified of people. i was afraid at any moment that they would hit me or threaten me like my dad. My dad hit me the least but his size and strength was enough to scare me. The sound of his work boots and keys as he stomped up the stairs to force us out of bed at 5am every weekend to work with him always scared me as a kid. I did my best to impress him whenever i worked with him, but he never paid attention. Instead he would always call me lazy and say i never did enough. 

I hate the way i look. I feel so ugly all the time. My parents never hesitated to call me and my older brothers fat and there was a time period that it got so bad that we would always weigh ourselves to keep ourselves in check. I remember being called ugly so many times in school especially in high school. It was so random when girls would say it too. As time went on it bounced back between Ugly, awkward, weird, or scary looking. Sometimes i was hit with all of it at the same time. With that i just like to keep my room as dark as possible so i can't see myself in the mirror. I wake up every morning hating myself and feeling bad that people have to look at my face. With the whole virus thing and us now having to wear face masks at work i feel happy that means no one has to look at my ugly face. I work out and go eat well but i still feel ugly no matter what. I remember one of my coworkers before they quit telling me that they never talked to me because they thought i was ""scary and ugly."" that really hurt my feelings because i was only nice to her. I do my best to speak softly and say, ""excuse me, please and thank you"" as much as possible because i'm afraid people will pick on me but i guess no matter what i do i'm always seen as ""scary looking.""

I was lucky enough for someone to at least think i was worth something. She was my first GF and she treated me so well. It was the first time a woman or hell anyone was actually nice to me, it was so new to me that i was scared of it. Even now when someone is nice to me i panic. But, like an idiot i blew it. My depression and insecurities made the relationship difficult for her. I saw this over time and instead of talking it out and telling her everything i ended things thinking, ""She deserves better than a loser like me."" Now that she's in a happy relationship i'm happy for her but i'm sad at the same time because i wasn't able to give her the love she deserved. Then i met someone who i just wanted to be friends with but she was obsessive and then forced me to do things i didn't want to do. Things that whenever i think about i feel disgusted and terrified.  It took me 3 years to open my heart up again to someone and when i did she cheated on me. However, she didn't consider us BF and GF so she says it wasn't cheating. I felt so used by her and when she said my depression was too much for her i broke down crying saying, ""I pushed another one away. God why am i never good enough. I just want to be normal."" 

I just feel so tired, i just want to close my eyes and just fade away. I can't take this anymore. I just want to feel normal. Normal as in waking up and not wanting to hide your face from the world. Normal as in being able to walk in public without having a panic attack. Whenever i try talking about this to people who say, ""Oh i understand you"" i realize they really don't. They say, ""yeah i get lazy sometimes too"" or ""yeah i've been depressed before i broke up with my GF or BF and i was pretty sad for weeks."" I don't expect anyone to completely understand what it's like but i also encounter those who want me to keep it all inside me. They say, ""Ugh, just quit talking about it and you'll feel better."" ""You don't see me always talking about what's wrong with me."" The most common one i hear is, ""you still think about that? come on that's in the past just forget about it."" I'm just so tired. I feel so alone when i try talking about all this. I just.. I just want to feel normal. I'm sorry. If you took the time to read this then i thank you for that.",False,2,0,0,0,0,depression

My ex and I have two kids together. We split a while ago, and he bought and moved into his own house about 8 months ago. We’ve been on really good terms, or so I thought.

So I had these two beautiful canvas pictures of both my kids when they were smaller hanging up on my living room wall. They’re huge and they were pretty expensive. I lost the original digital files.

Something has been different lately and I couldn’t quite put my finger on it until last night. I figured it out: those massive pictures were gone. They’re not small, you can’t just lose them. Honestly I don’t know how long they were gone for—I’m so disorganized and I just don’t notice details and I’m always rushing around in a cloud of chaos.

I texted my ex to see if he somehow knew where they were. He has access to my house because honestly, I keep forgetting to change the locks. He denied it but then condescendingly asked if I ran out of medication and lost them, like some bumbling idiot. I have ADHD, I’m not stupid.

I just feel taken advantage of. He knows how disorganized I am, and that I wouldn’t notice right away. And he was right. I’m not crazy, I didn’t misplace these gigantic pictures on my wall. I feel terrible for not noticing—honestly it could have been weeks, days, I just don’t know. 

It makes me wonder how much else is missing that I blamed my ADHD and habit for misplacing things on. A bunch of Christmas presents went missing last year in very similar circumstances. I just blamed myself but a little part of me knew that maybe it wasn’t just me being scatterbrained. This could have been going on a while. I feel so used.

2020-05-03 10:27:07,ADHD and subculture (and relationships).,Questions/Advice/Support,"By subculture I mean cultures that are seen by normal society as odd, rebellious, criminal. Using the term broadly. 

I've always been drawn to these kinds of groups, since I was a tiny kid, many of which have been a little traumatic. I mean like friendships, situations, as well as scenes, like rave, punk, queer stuff. I worked as a male prostitute, sold drugs, etc etc, and all those times and experiences fulfill me massively, despite the dangers. I've often found it hard to 'settle in' to family and love, and don't really have any friends who I would consider normal. 

It seems to me to make sense from the perspective of ADHD - not just the 'seeking intensity' thing but the sense of anger and frustration at society, being rejected, shamed, punished etc, and developing amazing cultural outputs (with hyperfocus) that celebrate these tendencies, at risk of death or jail.

In basic form, it's like on the one hand there's a somewhat destructive attraction to subcultures (VALUABLE) which it's not really feasible to sustain, and then a yearning / need for more healthy (BORING) long term interests being fulfilled. 

I am curious to read more about this, but a lot of the articles and books I've found online seem quite straight and normal. Like, ""10 tips for a happy marriage."" I see the value of these things, but I wonder if anyone knows of any sources that deal with this side of ADHD, written more from inside it? 

This is a very over simple metaphor, but if Kurt Cobain or some of the wild drag queens in Paris is Burning or Jimi Hendrix are 'ADHD type people', are there things that they would be able to read about love, relationships, long term safety, that would also be relevant for the angry damaged resistant side of those personalities? 

For all the use its given me, I've often found therapy to be somewhat of an attack on my character, culture and interests. 12 steps was like chemotherapy, know what I mean? Gained some long term healthy habits, at the expense of some very important traits, contacts and... 'sub-cultural identity.'",False,5,0,1,0,0,adhd

2019-02-06 21:09:03,How do you deal with undiagnosed ADHD in university?,,"I'm a Gr. 12 student who has always excelled in school, mostly because of a decent memory for textbook stuff and because I have crippling anxiety that makes me do schoolwork at the cost of everything else haha. 

I've also had two nervous breakdowns recently (including multiple hospitalizations and fracturing bones hitting things. I've never ever been this crazy before), and I'm terrified for university. I cannot function without a schedule. 

I decided to graduate early, so I really just have a paper course to complete this semester, then I'm home free. It's going pretty well, because I'm really good at hyperfocusing for 5+ hours, and it's a course I like. 

Problem is, if I have anything else planned for (or come up in) the day, I get absolutely NOTHING done. I'm pretty sure it's the transitioning that gets me. 

My parents are now making me study in chunks, with mandatory breaks in between, and they're adamant that this will teach my brain how to study without needing to hyperfocus. Idk if that's legit

I'm currently on Wellbutrin for anxiety, and also off-label for focus issues, which the kind Dr. actually listened to me on. It makes me bomb at starting tasks and zenning the hell out, but that's it. 

I took Dexedrine once (given to me by parents, as I have sibling with ADHD) and it was amazing, i felt like I was seeing everything on a big screen, rather than through a microscope. I went to a dinner and genuinely had fun and could talk to people without being spacey. I didn't cry all day, which is rare for me lmao. 
Unfortunately it also gave me a decent crash which scared my parents off from ever giving it to me again. I also may have had a mild nervous breakdown after realizing that this is how normal people feel like, and I'll probably never get to feel that again. 

I'm on a very long wait list to see a psychiatrist, so meds or therapy are not options. I also have a developmental disorder (diagnosed when I was very young) which my parents blame all these issues on. So I'm kinda alone in this. 

TLDR 
- I just needed to get everything out 
- I am basically alone in this, and I would appreciate some good tips for studying/living/transitioning 
-my parents think that 'teaching' my brain to focus on small chunks rather than one big hyperfocus will solve all my problems. Is this even possible?

I also used to be crazy scared of the world ending (flashbacks to the 2012 New Years Eve). Rationally I know that there's nothing I can do, or nothing to even worry about because it's some crazy conspiracy theory but I just never could shake it. There are many other examples of things that I'm not too scared of anymore but which are now coming back, driving is one of them. I had also made enormous progress when it came to making phone calls but I feel like it's slowly getting worse again as well, for example.

Another thing I do is trying to find out why I'm instinctively avoiding certain situations. This takes me back to something I'm afraid of which I had honestly forgotten about.

Nonetheless the debate led into me talking about marketing (my major that I’m graduating in 1 month with). 

I left that debate feeling pretty peeved. I felt like they weren’t wanting to here me out, and that they wanted to tell me what my own major was. They boiled my major down into advertising and social media. At that point I quit debating because it was obvious that their points were coming from a place of ignorance on the very subject we were debating. 

It’s not the first time they’ve made comments about my major being “easy”. Sometimes they’ll see the median salary for a digital marketing job I’m applying for and say, “YOU CAN GET PAID $X JUST TO TWEET?!” Obviously digital marketing encompasses a TON more, especially in the last couple of years.

2020-06-26 05:30:31,Is it normal to worry about anxiety/panic attacks?,Advice Needed,"Potentially triggering in terms of panic attacks, I guess. I'm not really sure how it works.

I've dealt with a few full blown panic attacks in my life, but I often deal with ""almost"" anxiety attacks, often during times of stress, but also when I allow my mind to drift to the topic, and I think, ""Oh, now is really not a good time to get a panic attack.""

I feel the sinking feeling in my chest first, and, if I let it progress, I'll start shaking, my heart will start pounding, etc.

I can usually ward off an attack, though, with a coping mechanism I found. Basically, I contract my throat muscles/diaphragm over and over, and the feeling of pressure in my chest/throat keeps me calm. I'm probably explaining that horribly, but it's an internal feeling of pressure - it's diffiult to explain. Regardless, it helps.

At this point, I do the coping mechanism probably every day, almost unconsciously. It might be the equivalent of popping Xanax though, because when I went to a dentist recently, I couldn't do it, and I had to blast music in headphones, and I was still essentially on the verge of a bad attack the entire time. I was thoroughly sweating and shaken up by the end of it. 

Usually though, I'm fine. Sometimes it's worse, but I can almost always stop it from developing.

Is it worth going to a psychiatrist or something? I'm not sure what they would tell me, as I already have a coping mechanism.

The main point of my question however, is that I've recently become hyper-aware of the possibility of an attack happening. When I'm driving or taking a test, I have to almost constantly ""cope"" because I'm so worried it'll be triggered. Is this fear normal? 

Thanks for reading this whole saga. I'm just not knowledgeable enough to know what to do, etc. on my own.

It was an antidepressant called Pristiq. I took it everyday because I really thought I was depressed. 
   About a week and a half later I was just sitting on my bed in my room watching tv. Out of nowhere I looked at my wall and my entire mental mind changed. There was no cause. No nothing. I got up out of my bed and was walking back and forth in my room holding my head with both hands clinching my hair. And told myself I would never take another antidepressant again because I thought that’s what caused it.
   Actual depression started happening, not the depression I thought I had. No. No.. this was real. Immediately waves of suicidal thoughts began uncontrollably. Over and over. It didn’t stop. My mind was a prison and I was the prisoner. 
   How does this happen? No cause, just uncontrollable severe depression that doesn’t stop. I began to have a plan if this didn’t stop in two weeks I was gonna kill myself. How does one be happy and love life then in a second it all turns upside down? 
  After two weeks it didn’t stop and every second that I was awake I wanted to die. But, I had hope because I was moving back in with my dad because now I’m thinking it was the house causing this depression. One month later I moved back in with my dad. I put the fakest smile on my face when I seen him. But we hugged and I went to sleep because I had school the next day and I actually wanted to go, I thought being around my friends would put my mind back into place. 
   Oh was I wrong. I wasn’t myself anymore, I completely lost the ability to have a sense of humor. I lost my personality and turned into someone else. I lost my motivation to even socialize anymore.
   I was amazed that I was only 16 and my life was already over. My grades dropped really far and my dad was angry. But I never told him or anybody what I was going through. I knew I had a mental disorder but I still to this day don’t know what it is. 
   And guess what? It’s 5 years later. I’m 21. I graduated high school because of hope. I graduated the Army because of hope and went on to be the best Private First Class I could be.
   I did it. I have two diplomas because I never stopped. But I still go through it everyday. As soon as I wake up I have thoughts of suicide. Everyday I’m really depressed, but it’s not as bad as it was. It has lessened a little bit and I’m thankful for that. I know what real depression is and it’s the worst kind of pain in this world. So do not say your depressed until you have uncontrollable thoughts about killing yourself everyday for 5 years.

I have a question though, has anyone ever experienced something like this? Where the depression just completely came out of nowhere",False,4,0,2,0,0,depression

But I'm struggling so badly and feel like there's nothing left for me. I'm 22 years old and while the rest of the people my age are out having the time of their lives, I am barely surviving. 

I have a list of things that make me happy even during the worst days, and this list is becoming progressively shorter by the day. Now watching mindless TV series, eating, petting my dog and sleeping are the only things that give me any sense of comfort and joy. 

I have attempted suicide three times this year out of desperation, each time ending up in hospital having hurt the people around me and plaguing them with guilt that they shouldn't be feeling. Every night I go to bed hoping that something will kill me in my sleep so I can rest forever without hurting the people I love. 

I used to be the bubbliest person, so much so that plenty of people would tell me I'm the nicest person they've ever met. If you met me now you would think I'm the most boring, negative, lazy and selfish person you've met. I also used to have a sense of humour and be insanely extroverted - that's all disappeared too. I don't even know who I am anymore. 

My home, my degree which will lead me into my dream career, my partner, my circle of friends (who I have mostly pushed away), the fun opportunities I am given (which I deny) - everything in my life is really, really good and yet I can't appreciate or participate in it like I used to. Instead I feel absolutely nothing about anything, and every daily task feels pointless and painful to me.

2020-06-19 01:47:25,I’ve lost faith in doctors,,"I’ve always had mental health issues. I’ve always known that I suffered from at least depression, tho I started to feel like it might be something more than just depression. I started seeing a psychiatrist about 3 or 4 years ago. Before that, I saw one or two therapists. At first, they said it was just depression and general anxiety. About two And a half years ago, they  gave me the diagnosis of bipolar 2. Which I accepted because multiple anti depressants didn’t help but made me worse, and even tho I didn’t talk to the psych much, she talked to my therapist and they collaborated together on that diagnosis.

Anyway, that psych was a complete bitch. She rarely listened to anything I said. She acted like she knew better than me. And when I told her I was still suicidal while on meds, she said that meds wouldn’t fix everything and I just wasn’t trying hard enough. I’m sorry, but meds should at LEAST make the suicidal thoughts lessen! If they don’t even do that, wtf is the point in taking them?? That’s when I switched psychs.

But anyway before I switched, I’ve been hospitalized multiple times. One time, I went to a different hospital. I was there for about a week but I barely talked to the psychiatrist. Throughout my entire stay, I probably talked to her less than half an hour. Yet somehow, she diagnosed me with alcohol use disorder. Even tho I NEVER talked to her or anyone else there about alcohol.

And now my current psych, every single appointment I’ve had, they’ve been late. Every single appointment, I wait past my appointed time. And not just Few minutes, but like half an hour or longer. And they never seem to care about any side effects. I’ve gained a ton of weight, and that wasn’t a concern to them at all, even tho it stresses me out. And then I switch my insurance. I give the office the info for it multiple times. But they never had an answer for me on how much I owed them. Suddenly, I owe them 1800. I have no idea how, since I haven’t had that many appointments since switching my insurance, unless they’ve been charging me without it and charging me a shit ton of money. I can’t even figure out what the hell is going on cuz their billing department won’t answer my phone calls.

So between doctors giving me diagnosis without really talking to me, doctors not giving a shit about what I have to say or what’s bothering me, doctors not giving a shit if the meds are working or not, and sneakily charging me an arm and a leg to be seen, I’m really over it. It’s making me wonder if I really have bipolar, or if they were just saying that to make me seem more ill and so they could use that as an excuse to see me more often and give me a shit ton of meds. Not to mention that they said I have bipolar two and a half years ago, and my life has just steadily gotten worse, since I was told that and started doing everything they said. I’ve gained a lot of weight. I lost my career and work as a cashier at a shitty gas station now because I can’t handle a real job.

2020-03-20 12:26:40,Finding the silver lining during this fiasco.,:thinking: Thoughts & Ideas,"Obviously things are very strange in the world right now. Everywhere you look there’s more and more bad news. While being realistic and understanding that things are different right now, I’ve been trying to keep an optimistic outlook (which sure as heck isn’t easy given the circumstances). So far I’ve found a few upsides to this situation. 


1) I’m a book worm and I frequent the public libraries to get most of my books. As of this week all libraries are closed indefinitely. Now, you would think this would be bad for me, but it’s not. A week before it was announced that all libraries would be closed, I had reserved 4 books, so that I’d be the next in line to take them out when they became available. The way it should have worked is that I’d be getting them one at a time, about a week apart. By some stroke of sheer luck, they all became available at the same time. I thought this was great but I got kinda stressed out, because now I had 4 books and only a few weeks to read them. I was just about finished my first book when the announcement was made that all libraries would be closed. With this though all late fees would be waived. Huge relief! Now I have 3 more wonderful books to keep me occupied, and once I finish those I can dig into my home library if need be. So, all in all, I’d call this a win.


2) Thanks to this pandemic I’m actually going to be able to get my bank account out of overdraft for the first time in over a year. I know this is the opposite for most people affected by this situation. I’ve been living on social assistance/ disability benefits for the last year and a half or so, due to mental health issues. With this I am living WAY below the poverty line. Today I woke up with a surprise deposit in my bank account that turns out is a bonus to help with groceries. Fortunately I’m already stocked up on groceries so I don’t even need to touch that money. Then just yesterday it was announced that anyone who receives my country’s quarterly tax benefits will be receiving $400 next month (over $250 more than what I’d normally receive). On top of all this almost all businesses are closed so I couldn’t even go and and spend all this extra money if I wanted to (even though it’d probably just get spent on more books). Having my account out of overdraft is going to be a huge relief.


I know things aren’t looking so great for a lot of folks, but like I said, I’ve been trying to stay optimistic during all of this and it seems to actually be paying off. It’s a small victory but I’ll take it. 


Stay safe and healthy folks. ✌️

To make a long story short, I was emotionally, physically, verbally, and sexually abused for the first eleven years of my life, and now I am adopted by my godparents, who I highly respect as my mother and father.Anyways, like I said, I'm a private person. This means people say things to me without thinking how I might feel about it. I also do not share my past memories with others- I need to move on. I cannot blame them for their ignorance, that would be rude.  So when people get mad, and yell at me, I leave my face blank and take it. But it's been hard lately. When my mom gets upset with me, practically anything that leaves my mouth is talking back or an excuse.

But I take it, and I bounce back.Those outside of family know me as a happy, innocent, smart, and responsible person. If I am ever anything except some state of happy, people think it's weird of me.

So I currently have a sinus cold and I had one of those warm drinks with paracetamol and pseudoefedryn. My stomach hurts because of it cause of my gastritis. My nose is very backed up and there's not much I can do but breathe through my mouth. 

The problem is I went to sleep and every time I try to relax enough to fall asleep I get shaken back awake by this horrible feeling that I can only compare with fear. I'm not having nightmares, I'm not even asleep. It feels like literally my heart stops and I have to gasp for air to come back. I took my blood pressure and it's normal, 112/77 and heart rate 67. This has happened before to some extent but it usually goes away after a couple of those bouts. I don't have a fever either 

A number of these were also accompanied by a feeling of pressure in my ears and dizziness. I tried to monitor my heart for a bit and the only bit I could pick up was that my heart rate goes up slightly when it happens, but that's expected considering I suddenly gasp every time.

2020-05-26 18:18:11,Looking for tips on dealing with identity shock,Questions/Advice/Support,"Apologies for long ramble with bad format, on mobile at work.

I’m not officially diagnosed (yet, I have an appointment tomorrow to move forward with a professional in ADHD). But in the last week+ I’ve been doing personal research and watching YouTube videos and searched the topic here which is how I found this sub of all you amazing people. Maybe I shouldn’t have but I looked it up in the DSM5 and I hit 8/9 for impulsivity and 7/9 for hyperactivity. Since I’ve been learning about the symptoms of ADHD the only way to describe how I’m feeling is dumbfounded and/or flabbergasted. All my life (26F) I thought I was inadequate at keeping up. I thought I had to ‘change’ myself to somehow become more motivated, less distracted, more objective, less sensitive, more and less at the same time. I’ve always known I’m not a total idiot but I was beginning to believe that I would never feel like I was on the same level as my peers. I internalized all the criticisms I’ve taken and started to think it was who I was as a person: lazy, head-in-the-clouds, spacey, easily excited, loud, can’t-mind-her-own-business, overly emotional. Now, after learning the limited bit I now know about ADHD I’m convinced this was my challenge from the beginning. I can remember how I was praised as “such a well behaved little girl, my kids wouldn’t be able to sit still for hours on end like that” while I attended government conferences with my single mom. Now I’m realizing that if it weren’t for the stimuli I took with me (Archie comics double digests + a novel, my Gameboy handheld, papers and coloured pencils to draw with, and a portable CD player; this was all before smartphones, mind you) I would’ve been just as rowdy and rambunctious as any other kid and probably more so because even with all those distractions I would *still* get up, wander over to the refreshments, and study the herbal tea packets, just to have something for my brain to focus on. I didn’t run around in circles screaming. I want to clarify: I didn’t *physically* run around in circles wanting to scream. And the constant stream of mental “look at that! Remember this! I wonder why.. hey, who’s that? Where are they going?” Etc.... I thought that neverending stream of mental junk was NORMAL. I thought EVERYBODY managed that constant, never ending reel of stuff, and that I was just shitty at managing it all.

I know other people have felt similar, especially with diagnoses beyond childhood. I’m wondering how to better manage the overwhelming emotions that are matching pace for pace with the overwhelming thoughts. My brain has always been go, go, go, but now it’s thinking “I’m not stupid, this isn’t natural, this isn’t normal for everyone else” and it’s hard to not get swept up in the “looking back at what might have been”. I want to look forward because depression has kept me stuck. 

I know compassion towards myself is a must, but it’s tricky.

Also, I live with my fiancé and his family (basement apartment). They all seem to be very “life is what you make it” type thinkers. I’ve told them about my research and my upcoming appointment but they’ve given me this analogy: they’re interested in the picture on the tv screen; I’m busy trying to explain all the wiring and technicals behind the screen that puts the picture up there. It’s not a bad analogy by any means, but it’s isolating to feel like I need to wait for them to take an interest in the technicals. Any anecdotes for dealing with neurotypical loved ones is greatly appreciated. 

I’ve felt so much better and self-accepting since realizing this might be (probably is) my issue. Maybe I’m not a fuck up. Maybe I’m not lazy. Maybe I’m not stupid. Maybe being so emotional has an actual medical cause.

2020-05-19 06:09:06,I hate you. I never loved you. I loved the ‘you’ I made up on my imagination. Rot in hell.,,"I have given you all my love, even though you never did jack shit for me to love and care for you that way. You constantly manipulated me, constantly lied to me, constantly cheated on me, made me feel worthless, unlovable, undeserving of your time, priority, and even your acknowledgement of the fact that I exist.

But I stayed with you for four years because I still loved you very much. I think I’m slowly starting to understand why. I have always imagined what you could be if you were good to me, if you loved me, if you cared for me. I imagined a perfect man. My depression and loneliness then made that imagination so strong that I couldn’t differentiate between the knight-in-shining-armor of a man I fantasized you to be and the devil you actually were. I stayed with you because you were the closest thing to my imagination who actually wanted me, even if to just use me. Because I know that no one else will ever want me.

On top of that, I also had hope; hope that maybe even the smallest part of you loved me. Very unjustified and misplaced, but hope nonetheless. I convinced myself that if I worked hard enough, I could make you see that I can be worth loving. 

I miss you all day everyday. But realizing that I only loved my own imagination of you rather than the real you has been helping me move on little by little. Maybe one day I’ll realize that even being sad and lonely forever is better than being treated so horribly like you treated me. Maybe one day I might even move on completely, but that sounds almost impossible right now.

I hate you for being so bad to me. I hate you for ruining my life. You tainted my heart. I can never be with anyone again, because you took my ability to love from me when you showed me the consequences of loving the wrong person. I miss you, I love you, and I hate you.

2020-01-23 16:33:11,I’m from Colorado. Been to Vegas twice. Stayed on the strip. Kinda made me feel poor or that I shouldn’t be on the strip.,:chat: Just Chatting,"So long story short: best friend of mine, his dad does pool tournaments at bailys hotel on the strip and I am invited along and  so I came. Each time we were ther about a week. 

Fun fact: the night before both times we would all get tossed so we’d be hung over the next morning and go to the tournament to compete and lose the first round both years lol. 

So anyways now getting to the money aspect. 

Bailys allows smoking so the main lobby is a sleazy smoke filled lobby and then you get your room key and whatnot. The rooms are actually pretty damn nice. I always got a full king bed. 

We would get breakfast in the morning at the five Starbucks licensed shop... $13!!!

Walk around the strip, always with alcohol  half toasted with those novelty liter liquor cups like the long neck one or a boot or I liked to call it the holy grail. 

So walking the strip is it’s always crowded. Stay with your group or you’re screwed. And mainly the shops and the restaurants are what made me feel poor now that I think about it. 

Every liquor drink is $20-$25. I think you get a discount if you have a cup. So trying to save money? Keep the first novelty cup you buy. 

Breakfast restaurant for four people would be $80-100. 

Lunch I would usually skip or eat a snack and then dinner I swear we would always eat at the fanciest places and for one person full meal would be 40-50. 

I would always just bring cash to Vegas. I didn’t want to use my credit card at all. 

So everything on the strip is premium top dollar stuff. I wouldn’t even bother going into shops if I wasn’t just looking. 

But the second I went to I believe 5th street, close to where the pawn stars pawn shop is. ( I met the museum guy) the prices on the outlet mall were much more reasonable and whatnot. 

So tldr: on the Vegas strip it was too expensive and on 5th streeet outlet mall where they have a zip line. It was way more reasonable.",False,3,0,14,0,0,non_clinical
2020-04-27 15:35:22,Anxiety/deppresion support,REQUESTING SUPPORT,"Hi,

so about 7 months ago I started struggling with anxiety,  it first started with school, scared of bad grades, then it proggresed so far that I couldn't even handle stepping into the school anymore. As soon as I got close to the school I just had an insane panic attack, shocked, shaking, sweating. I just couldn't handle it and I always called my mom, she was always supportive and told me I could go home. So I seeked for help and started visiting my therapist. My therapist is a lovely woman, but I found that she didn't help me that much. So I visited a psychiatrist which gave me a prescription for some medicine. I'm taking the medicine for about a month now, but is isn't that effective. I'm basically hopeless at this point, tried everything, watched videos, seeked help, talked with my mom etc. I have a goal in life, but I'm just so tired of constantly not sleeping, waking up 1 hour before my normal cycle so I could calm down a bit, being tired, not having energy for anything. The only thing that keeps me at life is my mom and my friends. I am a really sensitive person and if anybody gets even a tiny bit mad at me, I always think that it's something tragic, being scared for an hour before I cool down. When they get mad at me I always go cry somewhere and think about suiciding as I always think I am a misery at that point. My parents are divorced and I'm always scared to visit my dad as he's quite mad for every single thing and I'm scared he will get mad at me as I don't know how to defend myself and I always take everything very personally. Me and my mom also live with a guy that she met, but he's always somewhat tired and ""bitchy"" or how would I say it? I'm super uncomfortable being around him. I'd rather be hungry than go eat when he's down in the kitchen. Basically it's really tiring for me to live with him. Now the anxiety has proggresed even further, I'm scared everyday about my parents, will anything happen to them?, I'm extremely scared of death and I can't fall asleep for about an hour as I start thinking about death. I'm scared of heights now, never before. I'm scared to go in lifts now, to go outside, cross the road as cars can hit me, scared to go into a car as there may be a bomb beneath it, I can't live like this anymore.",False,2,0,2,0,0,depression

I started on Ritalin (worked for a while) moved to Vyvanse (don't remember but there was an issue) then Strattera (had horrid suicidal depression), Adderall (couldn't eat) and then the magic pill was Concerta. I stuck with Concerta for the longest (10 years) then I tried to get off meds for college. 

Well that sucked cause it took me 6 years and like 8 major changes. Don't make my mistake, utilize your resources. I went into a deep depression and barely made it out of school.

2019-01-02 21:31:02,I can’t grasp my emotions,,"Constantly I have been feeling two-sided with how I feel. When I experience something, I may feel a certain way, but my reaction would be totally different. There are many scenarios where I felt this. I have been told by a friend of mine that at times when I'm not preoccupied/distracted; when I'm waiting for the bus, eating, and such, I appear angry, though at times like that, I don't really have anything going through my mind. I decided to try to cease the angry image and relax, but instead, I shifted to a ""looked like I was about to cry"" image. Most of the time, I can't really describe my attitude, it's not that I don't feel anything, but there isn't a feeling to describe me. I simply exist.

When I was younger I abandoned my feelings. I was extremely self conscious so I tried to fit in and once I understood that I couldn't fit in, I tried to change. Despite my efforts, I was still seen as insignificant, I believed no matter what, I wasn't enough. Understanding that my efforts where hopeless, I gave up. I stopped trying to put effort, to care, to value life. I purposely separated myself from others, I tried to stop feeling.

I understand that this was a bit dramatic and this story sounds like fake self diagnosed depression, which it probably is, but the problem still stands, and I want to start putting effort into being more expressive with how I feel, instead of feeling like nothing. Of course I still have emotions but they are buried. How exactly can I regain the emotions that I've dug?

2019-09-24 02:57:59,Opened up about my Anxiety at work and now I'm numb..,Work/School,"I've had the effects of anxiety for the better part of 30 years. Having racing thoughts as a kid, teenager and as an adult was pretty challenging for me. Anxiety has led me into a few breakdowns and even a hospitalization in which I dont generally disclose it. People would perceive me as as standoffish, a workaholic, high-strung, awkward, arrogant and a variety of other behavioral terms I've been labeled as throughout my almost 40 years of existence within this world. 

I've struggled to hold down steady employment for the last three years time. Previous to that I had two jobs in a 12 year span and although they were high stress, I muddled through them as best I could. My anxiety drives me to work at a feverish pace, going 110% without stopping and I generally master my jobs in a fairly quick amount of time. I do get caught up in my mistakes, thinking that one mistake will lead me to be fired and then I'm making multiple mistakes over and over again. 

All of this pre-explination leads me to my current plight. I work in a true ""blue collar"" atmosphere. My work has conservative talk radio blaring all day long, 24/7 which has given me second thoughts into EVER disclosing my mental health trials. 

Everything has been pretty smooth, I've gotten along reasonably well with everyone until just recently I had a Project Manager who was giving me the cold shoulder for some strange reason. I tried being happier and upbeat, friendly and approachable but it just wasn't clicking. The said ""PM"" randomly approached me a couple of weeks ago and asked for me to review se of his work that doesn't fall within my work scope. Being happy to help (I'm generally a people pleaser), I edited his documents as requested. When I gave him the project back I again was greeted with the cold shoulder. Within a couple of days I started getting tons and tons of additional tasks from this PM that flustered me to no end. Items such as calling to reschedule his hair appointment, move project files around that were not needed or necessary and overall just a whole lot of extra ""grunt work"" that wouldn't be asked of anyone. 

All of this came to a head last Friday when I reported for work and asked if I could leave work for some personal business. This was after I was told by another employer that I'm ""too ambitious"" and someone else told me not to make suggestions or offer insight into my experience with bringing value to the organization. I really was in a tailspin and headed for a downhill turn.

Now, my General Manager didn't have an issue with my leaving but I was blasted with four tasks in rapid succession before I made it out of the door by the PM, the GM and another member of management. I was in a pretty dark place throughout the entire day Friday and even in to today. My weekend was pretty shot with a ton of racing thoughts and near panicked attacks ensuing. I pressed ahead and made it through to report to work on time this morning. 

First thing this morning my GM walks in and greets me. I bid a hello and a few minutes later I asked if I could unload some work off of my plate that's been overwhelming me. My GM agreed and within an hour that workload was relieved from me. However, before this had happened I told my GM that i suffer from anxiety and when I get overwhelmed I tend to shut down. He said that I have to stop volunteering for extra work and put the workload onto my counterparts in our home office a couple hundred miles away from us but it wasn't really addressed or not addressed. The guy is pretty old school and is pretty dry but he's talked about a grown son who lives with him who suffers from depression.

So my workload is lightened which is a great thing in the short-term but this is a smaller organization consisting of about 200 total employees. When someone discloses something such as this to a member of management, it has a tendency to get leaked to other personnel. I knew this going into opening up but felt it necessary to lay the groundwork for an ADA accommodation if needed. It still scares me though because I don't often trust or open up to people and in previous work environments when I've done it, I've been turned into the social outcast. So now I'm scared because I needed to unload my workload but I'm also scared because I've disclosed my mental health condition which may or may not be indirectly used against me. 

All of these events has lead me to become very emotional to the point of crying on my way home from work today. I will tell you that almost all people I meet tell me I look terrifying so me crying definitely isn't a norm and hopefully it will pan out. Overall I'm feeling a bit lost and not quite sure what or how to think about all ofthis. About the only thing I can do is to wait and see. Thank you for reading this if you've made it to the end.

The brown-reddish, rough, and narrow way is like a path full of tiny pieces of old-smelled chocolate, scattered on the deep and extensive ground. The complexion of what we imagined is so syrupy, that even the fastest runner cannot pass through it. This is how unwanted challenges hinder us in everyday life, sticking us on our places, hurting our feet and gradually striking our hearts full of fiery confidence.

We are isolated to the place of necessity and importance, for Time is always there, lurking like a wild beast surrounding our fragile core of life. Tendering the times that we are still little kids, a seedling is a young tree waiting for love and needs, as it is always there and tamed by possessive hands with humongous and creative mind, bending by an attachable thoughts.

Aggressively, Time will change the demising fate, to a very more lethal nightmares. The dark and intangible hue of the night is holding our weaknesses and energetically manipulating it, but it was merely begged, and we are glad that the warm and calming morning is always there, still making us happily alive. Our life goes on, even the times that Time always switch the situation to very obnoxious and gloomy coincidence. Life is surely cruel as Time, but we still strategically manage to go on further until we reach the hoping satisfaction, which is 
success.

Right to the time we are starting, wild thoughts with newly expressed ideas is starting to bloom out, while leading us to this place, which is San Pablo City Science Integrated High School. Keeping up the verbal encouragements and mindful trusts, we are still bound to weird and yet intriguing past traditions as walking down to the rocky path of the imperfect figured campus. The noisy breeze and calming silence is covering up the knowledgeable place, chilling down through the living spine. Capturing the countless breathes, entering to the seems old-like green building is like being engulf by a new, fresh and odd challenges.

As we enter the enormous and brownish metal gate of the school, the loud noise of students welcome our tiny eardrums. The audible sound is varied in different pitches and tones, that by which is echoing in different direction. There is no single place without noise, except perhaps, the deafening sound of silence in the humble school's library.

Without any disturbing hesitance, we quietly walk. With our trembling feet due to lack of confidence, we come through the dusty hallway, leading inside the old senior high school building. The trail which is highly remembered, is somewhat towards again to the 2-storey old green building, which the smart alumni called “Pure gold”, and to a newly constructed 4-storey yellow building, the room of which the most brave and cunning people houses and conquers the challenges. They are as big as an ancient brown mammoth ever lived, which that the school had provided for them the unbalancing knowledge they deserve.

As we are going our way through the tremendous old senior high school building, which is now standing in front of our magnificent eyes, we caught a glimpse of many unfamiliar strange faces talking loudly inside our room. We know it is our room because there is a printed and common sign showing the word “Gauss”, situated on the very rigid wall of the breezy room. Inside, many strangers' eyes pointed and follows us. The faces vary in many uncovered aspects like skin tone, pitch and loudness of voices coming out from their unseen voice box. Some are already having a fun time with the others, crackly laughing and chaotically chattering, but for us who is new at this environment, is just sitting on our chair. We keep being tediously still as we are still actively coping up with this new feeling of environment and the people which comprises in it.

Though unsurprisingly expected, there is no life without hard challenges as it is not worth living at all. The first day was restlessly fine but perhaps, there is no lesson from the hard working teachers or any sort, but here comes the true and most haunting day as a senior high school student. Second day comes, we still keep the unexplainable nervousness and Trembling excitement. The teachers started to teach their own expected lessons, which are new and remarkable subjects and topics. It was a bit jolt for everyone who come from an easy and relaxed life to view these disasters coming ( as the students say it ), which ready to destroy and obliterate anyone who will come on their smooth way.

Aside from the unexpected subject, It seems that also the current environment is not cooperating as well. The people around us are very intimidating. Though many are exquisitely genius and very favorable, almost one-fourth of the class come from the same obvious school we are right now. Also, everybody is actively participating in the interesting lessons and what really hinders us the most, are the sharp and profound verbatim coming out from their babbling mouth.

Specifically and honestly speaking, the subjects, such as Pre Calculus and General Mathematics, gives us a lot of severe headaches every time we innocently talk about it. With its lines going up or down, or circling, so many kinds of really special cones, the unconditional functions, some are common or numbers that was more rational than the others. We can’t cope this chaos that bargaining us for it is the waterloo of our student mindset.

Together with these very difficult subjects, time management is also hard for us to establish. With many complicated activities that came from every known subjects, we hardly have no time to entertain ourselves. And when times come that many random activities or projects are simultaneously assigned, we have regretful troubles on what we are going to do first. These menacing problems are stacking up until we reach the tiring limit, as a result, there are some assigned tasks that was pass on a late unforgivable deadline.

With the newly discover subjects and people, we also uncover many traditions that are still practiced by the students of the school. As we hopefully remember, after the first ceremony of class opening, the Grade 12 students hurriedly line up in a row making a human wall-like structure on both side of the rocky trail going back towards our room. They welcome us merrily and energetically. It is a sign showing that every favorable students, though they differ in many covered aspects, are taught to be a better person. With these thoughts, we are able to lively cope up with what is newly happening to the school we entered at.

The past days had been awfully tiresome but super awesome. From those dark days, we optimistically realized that if we look at it in oddly different perspective, like those hard subjects, courageously view them as a challenge to our thinking skills, or those unbeknown strangers, look at them as struggling people open to be friends with. Hard subjects are meant to be normally easy through penetrating study and building a comforting connection to the subject. From then on, we keep striving very hard to study every broad lessons that are taught to us every single day, with a heart and mind.

Especially, these difficult ones were made easy by giving the proper focus on every plot topics. When reading, If one is not steadily focus on what he/she is reading, he/she might not potentially understand it at all. For example, in our Pre Calculus, particularly the conic sections, It is very important that we are able to freely visualize how a circle or parabola are formed, not just only through reading. Also, we insist to start opening the doors of our own personalities and let our classmates in. Step by step, we build grateful connection to others and gradually know them lightheartedly.

When the first quarterly exam come, everyone felt this freezing nervousness and coping excitement, even us. When the ready teacher come in, he hold in his arms the clapping and flying ( because of the movement ) pure and white papers with remarked questions printed on it .The night before the particular exam, we learned to handle strict time pressure because they usually restricted the students to study the scheduled subject after the previous exam. We made a locked schedule on what to study first and luckily we did. The results were so good as a fresh fruit picked from a strong tree, but we will not get that success without our loving family whose heart touching support never fade and our new classmates that are very supportive to one another. After all what happen, we still kept the accomplishing goal mind set to know the mystery and the hidden success of this lively school and to discover the hidden chivalry in our heart and mind.

Not astonishingly everybody would be given a chance to step out of the glutinous and chocolatey way of the formidable path of life. It is not always as perfectly straight and smooth as everybody think. There will be some cruel time that there would be rough ups with a straight and bright path at the top or rough ups with nothing straight at all. It is up to us how we will straighten that specific path. In our resourceful perspective, we are able to perseveringly pave the rocky road we have rode on and we are able to humbly grow and slowly cultivate ourselves to be a better plant. We have successfully sprouted out from the black and crispy plastic that was tight and enclosed us from the very start, when we were just a little and fragile seed. With enough sunlight and deliciously sweet water that is sipped by us, here we are, a strong, healthy and mature plant. Despite everything that chaotically occurred, the strong gust of challenges rushing towards us and the strong splash of activities, It had only made our stalks and stems as stout as it can be.

Seeds are particularly dependent to some natural factors like cool breeze of wind, spicy seasoning of the sun rays, sweet syrupy texture of water, and the dark chocolate earth or soil. With the creative completeness of these, the tenderness and the deliciousness of the plant will be a great success. If we have exert so much focus to something we love, we may be strongly able to achieve what we really want. Second, building a strong and unbreakable connection to something, that something will be an awesome thing. Last, many bitter efforts and doings, if applied to something, a special something, might end up into a sweet and delicious outcome.

As Time flies fast, like a mighty vulture targeting its weak prey, the growth of our sturdy and green leaves also glides rapidly. We have enough necessary supplements to support our growing selves, but this will never be the strangest end of all ends. As we continue to harmonically grow, we still need to strive hard to support our precious lives and selves. When we lively grow to what we likely want to be, a stalwart or strong tree, that is when the time to realize that, those enormous challenges were not as always enormous as what we thought at first.

Now, we look upon the blue and highest point of the clear sky, the sky of true success. Scattered upon the voluminous space of the sky, waiting to drop and be felt by our faces, are the misty clouds of hope - the purest of euphoria hopes you will ever deliciously taste. No matter how dark and bumpy the path may be, there is always an end to reckless darkness. Together with the brave and strong people around us, we have reached the high peak of our success and in the near future, new seeds will come from the sprightly plants and go to another adventure to reach up for the bright and candescent skies of hope.",False,2,0,0,0,0,non_clinical

2019-07-15 17:27:10,Working hard and still failing to meet expectations,Rant/Vent,"I recently started getting treated for ADHD. I was diagnosed over 15  years ago with depression, anxiety/panic disorder and ADHD but never got treated for the ADHD because my problems always seemed more related to the depression/anxiety. Until I had surgery in back in January. Now the ADHD has become totally out of control. My doctor signed me out of work for 2 months because I kept getting in trouble (MAJOR screw ups because of memory problems, getting distracted and trouble organizing my time and tasks) even when I was convinced that I got everything right. I thought I'd lost my mind.

&#x200B;

Anyway, I've been back at work since May, struggling through my med changes, behavioral changes and trying to get a few accommodations in place to help me perform better at work. The person in charge of reviewing ADA Accommodation requests told me it would be no problem getting these. However, my boss is really digging in her heels about making any changes at all unless HR forces her to do it. So far, I've gotten cubicle partitions thanks to HR. I have a verbal agreement with my boss that I could make my own schedule (to cover the office phone, the major job duties are performed around the building away from the office) and wear earplugs when I needed to. However, my boss has re-written department policy in such a way that actually using my accommodations leave me open to disciplinary action. Plus, there are things added that I feel like I'm definitely going to fail my next evaluation on because it involves how I'm to have my inventory, my laboratory classrooms, storage areas and repair room organized and that it will be evaluated by random walk-through inspections by my boss. 

&#x200B;

I feel like I've been doing pretty okay with just the meds , the partitions, and the coping skills that I've learned. The problem is that it feels like if it's not one thing I'm messing up on, it's another. Now my boss has started documenting all of my mistakes. I've been doing this job for 7 years without a bad review and now I get pulled into the office to be ""spoken to"" about every little thing.   I explained that I CAN DO MY JOB WITH THE ACCOMMODATIONS, but she just insists that her department doesn't operate that way and that if I'm ""already freaking out during the slow summer"" that I should consider going elsewhere. 

&#x200B;

So, yeah, after giving 7 years of good work I'm definitely feeling un-valued and demoralized enough to leave but I have no idea what I would do or where I would go. I'm nearly 40 years old w/ a BS in Biology and not sure I'd be able to get a Master's degree with the way my brain functions now and I'm not sure what subject area I'd even get a Master's in if I did try to do it. On top of that, I just don't know that I can put the time and energy into a job search when it's all I can do just get through the work day right now.

So I googled some lists, and anything that sounded good, I looked at reviews. Here was my experience:

A few people giving basic reviews like ""I like this wine, inexpensive and good with ____"" but then on the other half, a bunch of one star reviews. These one star reviews were about the snobbiest things I have ever read. These people acted like if someone killed their family member in front of them, they would be more upset about drinking that wine. That wine was the spawn of satan. You would have to be human filth, the lowest of the low, the peasant of peasants, to even consider looking at the wine. If you were not drinking from a $200 bottle, it was not worth it. 

It makes it really hard for someone like me to get into it when there are so many snobby people, it is pretty off-putting. All I want to know is if something is decent tasting for the price. I bet it doesnt compare to the best of the best, I don't really care if it does.

2020-05-29 02:58:37,What has helped your work/job anxiety?,Work/School,"I have GAD, so pretty much everything gives me anxiety. The biggest barrier for me however is work. I am petrified of failure, and feel the need to be perfect at everything I do as well as not let anyone down. Work has me feel like I need to do well not only for myself, but for the people I work with and the people I help. And since work is such a big part of everyday life, this is something I can’t ignore.

I’m 23 and have had a total of two jobs. One was a work study when I was 20 for about 10 months (had to leave because I wasn’t technically a student at the college anymore) , another was a cashier for 7 months until this past October (my anxiety got way too high, literally was thinking about killing myself instead of going to work. Was very distressing.) my work study job wasn’t that anxiety inducing, as all I did was filing and scanning documents. I knew pretty much what I was doing each day. My cashier job had me incredibly anxious always before work. I guess I did a good job at it, but when I made mistakes it was the worst thing ever... 

I’ve been in therapy for 5 years for my anxiety, and with covid-19, getting a job has been put on the back burner for a bit. What slightly lessens the burden about getting a job is that I’m a full time grad student, majoring in clinical mental health counseling. (For some reason my anxiety over school isn’t debilitating, I think it’s because I’ve been in school since I was 5) I really want to get another job before I graduate in 2022 though. I need more job experience (although my therapist said when I look for a job after graduation my internships will be looked at more than my jobs) not just for professional reasons, but personally. I know physically I can work (all my co-workers and bosses really liked me! I wish this was enough to lessen my self doubt and anxiety...) but mentally it can be a lot. I just want to do so well. Also, I want to save money since I will have a lot of student loans. 

Of course, I have the fear of having major job anxiety when I’m actually in the field of counseling. I believe I can do it, I am really passionate about mental health and a good listener, empathetic, caring, etc. My professors are all complementary of my work and capability. My therapist believes I will be a good therapist. But still, this is something I have wanted for so long that I’m terrified of it causing me distress. This goal of mine has really kept me motivated and hopeful amidst my mental health struggles. 

Anyways.... if anything helped you in regards to work anxiety, I’d be happy to hear about it. I have so much knowledge about anxiety, my anxiety itself, and what I need to do to improve myself from not only being a client but also majoring in psychology in undergrad and now also being a counseling major but as you can see all of this anxiety still has a hold on me. It can be very frustrating. Trying to remind myself that this is all a process and I’m getting there. Re-wiring years of a certain mindset takes a lot of work. (Sorry, I always give myself pep talks / rational words whenever I spew about my anxiety.) (I realize I don’t have to apologize but I feel the need to because it makes me feel better. Anxiety!)

Edit: to add on, I am also working on my self-esteem as well, because it has a big affect on my fear of work. I’ve been writing multiple times (3-4) a day in a journal positive affirmations about myself and sitting with them. If there are any tips or exercises that help you in regard to self esteem that would be appreciated as well. Thanks and love to you all!",1590717799.0,1,0,3,0,0,anxiety

2020-07-08 02:54:18,I Feel Like I Waited Too Long To Get Help,Needs A Hug/Support,"I'm feeling really hopeless.  I have recognized for quite some time that I have social anxiety and an extreme extreme fear of public speaking (not like public speaking used to make me nervous, then I just practiced a lot and now I'm better, like a physical aversion full of tembling voice, shaking, beet red face, sweating - it's hard for people to watch).  But, it's like I have multiple personalities.  Some people know me as super outgoing and always say that I can carry a conversation with anyone.  But, then there are groups of people that make me super uncomfortable (my boyfriend's family) and I just lose all of my wit.  I just draw a blank when they say something to me, especially if it's something quippy.  I get beet read and shaky.  It's so embarrassing when the whole world can see just how anxious you are.  I think I am ok in small groups with people who I am comfortable with, having casual conversation.  I think even if I were to stand up in front of the room and give a powerpoint presentation to my boyfriend, I would feel nervous though and I certainly felt nervous in every single work situation where I did.  I even quit a job after having a particularly embarassing anxiety attack during a presentation.  Then, at my new job I was unexpectedly introduced at a meeting and I went BEET red (would have taken propanolol had I known it would happen) I wasn't even asked to speak they just mentioned that I had started.   The guy who merely mentioned my name profusely apologized probably the next 5 times that I saw him because it was so obvious that I was embarassed because I was the color of a tomato.  Omg once they sang happy birthday to me at work....you get the idea.  I can't handle attention. 

I don't know why someone with my levels of anxiety would do this but I enrolled in law school (I'm 32 BTW) in a night school (kept my job too).  We brief cases, where you just talk about a case for a few minutes and the professors ask you questions, and I let my anxiety take over all day long in anticipation.  I procrastinate at work, get nothing done other than reading my case over and over and over and thinking about what I'll say.  I've tried writing a full script, I've tried bullets, I've tried winging it.  Every single time no matter how I prepare I BLANK and lose myself in my explanation, totally forget what happened and need to consult my notes, and I cannot answer the simplest questions from my professors, like my mind just stops working when I'm asked a question in front of everyone.  I take propanolol for the shakes and red face (sometimes it works, sometimes I still show physical symptoms).  But, there's nothing that I know of to help with drawing a total blank.  I am sure my classmates think I'm an idiot (and law school is competitive and mean so that's not just the anxiety talking) but that's fine, what concerns me more is that I can't do this for a living! I never got any help for my anxiety, because after all of these years I got by.  I don't think you can spend 32 years of your life terrified of so much as asking a question in a classroom (something I don't think I've honestly EVER done) to suddenly speaking in front of people confidently.  I'm realizing how much if affected my ability to communicate too, because I make my point so much FASTER than everyone else, they go into all of these details and all of these thoughts when they're talking and I'm just like boom this is what's important, that is all.  But, ok I can do transnational work and not go to court, I never saw myself as a litigator anyway.  But, I still have to make presentations at work and I simply can't do it! I have trouble even speaking up in meetings, partially nervousness but partially after all of these years of being so quiet I don't even know what to say.  

Sorry this got rant-y, I just looked like an idiot in class tonight (the professor asked me a question that was honestly easy and I just blanked because that's what I do and after what felt like an hour of her realizing I wasn't going to say what she wanted she just got me to say ""yea"" and was like ""well that took a really long time to get a yea"").  That was after not being able to coherently explain the case.  I'm not stupid, I could have written a great paper about it! I would just give anything to be one of those people who can get up and talk in front of people without any worries.  Or to be able to strike up conversation with people I don't particularly mesh with.  I notice I really struggle to make eye contact with my SO's family so that's my babystep for myself.

I failed to complete college after multiple tries, I procrastinate everything, I'm late to everything, have trouble focusing at work, find new interests constantly that fall away quickly, and generally feel like I have not lived up to my talents and abilities at all.

I stumbled upon ADHD last November and got so excited reading and learning about the condition! I felt tears welling up when every description of ADHD sounded familiar. I shared the information with my girlfriend of 5 years who shared my surprise in how clearly the description of ADHD matched me.

I made an appointment at a behavioral clinic near me and saw a counselor for an intake appointment in December. She talked to me for less than 10 minutes, gave me a self survey to fill out, and told me I needed to see a psychiatrist for a diagnosis.

I was frustrated that the psychiatrist appointment was not until February. I've been anxiously waiting this psych appointment but have enjoyed lurking this subreddit and reading all of your success stories.

I've also been struggling at work and hoping that diagnosis and treatment would help me deal with those problems.

I finally had my appointment with the psychiatrist last night. He talked to me for no more than five minutes, told me to go schedule an EKG with my primary doctor, call his office manager in a few days to schedule a computer diagnostic test, and come back to him in two weeks after those things are done to complete diagnosis and possibly get a prescription for medication.

(Quick side note: 1. Go schedule an EKG. 2. Go schedule a computer test. 3. Schedule another appointment with me. - I'm getting it all done, but that's a lot of possible points of failure for a patient whose complaints are they can't motivate themselves to do things and are bad with organization! I'm surprised that a clinic that treats ADHD doesn't take some of the organizational tasks off the plate of their patients.)

I'm not sure why I had to wait a month and a half to talk to a psychiatrist for 2 minutes, only to have him give me some tasks to do and then come back to him. I feel like this could have been done in an e-mail six weeks ago.

I'm proud of myself for starting to manage my care and make progress towards diagnosis/treatment, but I'm disappointed in how little the counselor and psychiatrist  have actually talked to me!

I think I'm going to continue moving forward with this psychiatrist and see if I have a formal diagnosis and then see if I can start on a medication, because I've been really inspired to see how helpful treatment has been for so many people here.

But I think in the meantime I'd like to find a qualified therapist or something who actually will talk to me about my problems and how to deal with them.

In person, when we meet to head over to my mom's place, he'd just be on his phone. He's always busy talking to his friends on WhatsApp, but somehow he doesn't reply me? If I ask him if he has an issue with me, he'd just act defensive and annoyed that I even talked to him. The only time he actually sounded ""nice"" was when he needed to borrow 100 bucks.

Mostly because I hate where I am in life; my job is  nightmare for garbage pay, the stress from it has set off my anxiety and depression and BP2D. I live at home with my parents due to chronic illness, I have Crohn's, endometriosis, and some other fun illnesses. I have zero savings. I'm nowhere near where I want to be, and I have severe lack of self esteem from that. 

I do have an amazing boyfriend. He's beyond wonderful and supportive and I often feel like I'm dragging him down but that's another story.

2019-11-02 18:54:21,Coffee Crisp - a proud Canadian success story,:food: Food & Drinks,"Coffee Crisp is a popular chocolate bar made in Canada by Nestlé Canada. It is my absolute favourite chocolate bar because it has so many unique characteristics. For example, the multi-layered texture. You start by enjoying the actual chocolate first then the crisp wafers and soft filling.  This is a perfect sequence for these ingredients as it allows some of the chocolate to merge into other parts of the bar. At this point, their distinct coffee aroma should engage your sense of smell to maximize the satisfaction obtained from the bar. When your sense of taste and smell work synergistically, the overall experience can be significantly enhanced and improved.

Now some may argue that Coffee Crisp is just Kit Kat’s little brother. Absolutely Not! Coffee Crisp has an aura of ‘sophistication’ that Kit Kat simply cannot match. In a philosophical sense, Coffee Crisp really understands what its eater truly desires and it provides that for them. Don’t get me wrong, Kit Kat is a bar that most people would enjoy, but Coffee Crisp is unparalleled compared to their mainstream counterparts.

We also cannot overlook the versatility of a Coffee Crisp bar. For example, you can consume the bar in many ways without disrupting the integrity of the experience. The texture allows you to dip the bar in coffee or milk and enjoy it soaked. Now dunking might be a bit too British for some, however the experience can be a very positive one for those who decide to give it a try. And as an etiquette side note:  dunking is frowned upon during a meeting at the office, so don’t do it there. Some other options are breaking the bar into small pieces and sprinkling it on ice cream or a waffle. Be creative and try new things, the options are limitless.

If you really think about it, a Coffee Crisp consists mainly of 3 main components. The actual chocolate, the crisp wafers, and the soft fillings. Each of these items are underwhelming on their own. However, when you combine them, it results in a *magic* of sorts. The flavor, texture and taste come together in a perfect manner, resulting in an experience that invokes a harmonious sense of enjoyment and fulfillment that is greater than the simple pleasure of enjoying the sweetness and taste.

Now I personally think it would be unethical to not discuss the nutritional label to compare it to other similar chocolate bars. So lets do that.  The value that we want to focus on is total sugar, as that is typically considered the unhealthiest item. Some comparable popular bars are as follows: Three Musketeers 40 grams of sugar, Butterfinger 28 grams, Twix 24 grams, Snickers 20 grams, Kit-Kat 21 grams. A Coffee Crisp compares at 23 grams of sugar. So although Coffee Crisp is not *the best* in this regard, it still has a very favourable sugar content compared to other top selling convenience store chocolate bars.   

According to its Wikipedia page, Coffee Crisp has several other versions of the confection. These include Raspberry, Caramel, White, 70% Dark among a few others. I acknowledge that some of these may appeal to niche consumers, but none of them compare to the original. An imitation can never be as good as the original. Sort of like how the sequel to a movie is rarely as good as the original film.  I don’t discourage people from trying these other versions, however as a rule of thumb, it shouldn’t replace the original bar in terms of the frequency of consumption.

Although Coffee Crisp is mainly popular in Canada, there is availability in other locations. For example, Australian specialty sweet shops carry the bar in several major cities. In the US, its primarily available in shops near the Canada–United States border. The bar in the US had been courted by Americans – an online petition took 6 years to bring the Crisp to the U.S. and succeeded in 2006, though the marketing and distribution was discontinued in 2009. The following is a Youtube video of an American eating and reviewing a Coffee Crisp bar: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enqw9xi4UMU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enqw9xi4UMU)  

For the most part, Coffee Crisp has received great reviews on sites like Walmart and Amazon. For example, user ‘Vanillia’ submitted the following review on Walmart Canada’s Website:  

*Coffee Crisp is a treat I indulge in embarrassingly frequently! In fact, it's my favourite candy bar. The crunchy wafer, subtle and smooth coffee flavour, and chocolate to bring everything together is what I like most about it. It's no wonder why Coffee Crisp is one of Canada's favourite treats (seriously, America, you need to catch up). Overall, the Coffee Crisp is a delightful candy bar for anyone, young or old.*

While user ‘Rgoldie’ on Amazon stated the following:

*What more can you ask for! Coffee Crisp is by far the best-tasting coffee bar, period! Good value for the money and didn't come melted. Will definitely buy again!*

He thinks I have a mood disorder (most likely bipolar II) on top of my mod-severe ADHD and wants me to see the psychiatrist there, another month and a half wait. A few things:

1. this isn't the first time someone's tried to diagnose me as bipolar. A couple years ago I saw a virtual psychiatrist who talked to me for like 15-30min and immediately prescribed me atomoxetine (Strattera) and lamotrigine (Lamictal). 
   1. I was annoyed b/c I didn't believe it was bipolar (b/c I felt AMAZING), just ADHD and didn't look up what either medication was used for so I didn't listen to when I was supposed to take them (Strattera in AM, Lamictal in PM) so I took them BOTH before bed that night.
   2. I was up till 4AM so I was like fuck this person they don't know me and dumped the pills and never went back
2. Fast forward to now, pretty sure I'm in another hypomanic state for the last few days because I feel WONDERFUL and my Adderall is not touching anything, probs making it worse tbh

She is everything to me, and is the only light in my day. She loves me like nobody else ever has. But I don't know how long she'll be enough. She is torn. Torn between me and her abusive family.

 I am a school student who is so occupied in co-curricular activities that I'm not present in class for 70% of the academic session. that being said, its no surprise that I'm not much of a scorer in school exams. Sure I'm in the top 10 and my parents are happy but I'm not a ranker. I, however, am as competitive as the rest of my friends and that is cut throat level. Generally, we don't let scores and results affect our friendship. And today I almost let it happen. I have three close friends in class-X, Y and Z (for simplicities sake). y is my best friend and we've known each other for 6-7 years.

We recieved our preboard answer sheets in school today and because I didn't care much about these marks, I checked my mistakes, kept my sheets in my bag and forgot about it. I got out of class and busied myself with work related to a  conference I'm organising in school this summer. 

So I'm going from the staff room to the computer lab and I see x,y and z roaming around. Knowing them, I know something's up as they NEVER roam around in school.

Turns out, Y took out my science answersheet from my bag and got three marks deducted (my content was correct but both me and the examiner had misread the question). X and  Z told him that snooping around my stuff was none of his business but he went ahead and did it anyway. Then, he told me that with a look of PRIDE on his face. I was flabbergasted. What type of guy takes pleasure in destroying his best friend's report card. When he told me this, I wanted to kill him with the pen in my hand. I mean, why the fuck would he mess with my sheet even after he had scored BETTER MARKS THAN ME??? 

So many thoughts passed through my head but not wanting to create a scene, I let it pass. Now that I think about it, a teeny bit of hatred comes into my head for my best friend which sounds kinda saddening.

2020-05-14 18:49:51,"Last year I was ""in college"" and waiting for a job promotion. So much has changed since then.",,"Hello, all, just venting here a little bit so I'm sorry if its sloppy and hard to read. Last year I was ""in college"", more like in the middle of my break from college and I was in the middle of a job promotion. I took a break from college because I was struggling and even though I had one or quarters left to take, I felt like I would not be able to pass these classes if I were to continue. I then focused on my job and getting my license and car since I felt like I had the time. At my job, I recently got promoted to a team leader at a restaurant close to school and it was only a matter of time until I started taking classes for shift manager. I thought everything was going to be fine but this was when everything started to go downhill.

At this time last year, I had already waited three months to start my shift managing classes and I was suppose to start in June. I was also suppose to learn more stuff about the restaurant that was sort of required to become a SM but my boss told me that we will get there. Sometime later my boss tells me that there was new process and that I would This led to a series of delays that resulted in me passing my class in late August. I would be fine but I had a lease that ended in September so I had to make a decision. There was a bus that travelled between cities so I thought I could just do that until I become a more established manager. This ended up being a waste of time since I started noticing how differently (not counting my classes) my SM process went compared to others before me. For example, there were four new SMs during my time there and all of them knew how to work every part of the restaurant and there was me who did not know every part. I ended up starting to learn the other parts in October, ten months after I passed Team Leader class in February when this SM promotion was pretty much confirmed if I did my part. I ended up leaving in November, and not on good terms, and also not getting a transfer because I doubted it would go through being a manager with no managing experience. 

In November, I had been moved in with my sister after my lease ended and this when we found out that we had eviction notice served to us last month so we had a month to move out. We then moved into their sister's house in this past  January just until we find an apartment and managed to find a job using my past experience despite not leaving on a good term with my old job. A couple of weeks in, the sister's husband accuses me of sleeping with the sister which forced me to move in with my aunt who I do not speak to at all. For some background info, my aunt took my two siblings and I in when my dad died. She does not speak to us and there's always this vibe that she is just watching us when you are around her. However, the first two months I had trouble getting another job, part of the reason was because I was stressed that I had to find another job using a shady but great experience at my old job. The coronavirus hit and I had to settle for a warehouse job. I have been working here for two months and I hate it so much. It's mainly the hours because I cannot find myself to sleep after work doing 3 days 12 hour shifts. I just crashed one of the equipment, that I drive all day on, on my last day there and did not report it because it's been my second time crashing during my time there and the first time it was excused because I was still in training. I've been stressing this whole time on whether or not I'm going to have a job come next week. I know I should not have done this so you don't have to lecture to me on that. I'm still just so stressed because of this job, if it isn't the crash that's going to fire me then it's going to be because of the amount of days I might have to take off to keep my head up, both literally (from sleep) and figuratively. 

I did not write much about school because there's a chance I can go back when I want because I still have all of my grade forgiveness left. I had taken a break from college because I was struggling but could not come back since I did not pass the required amount of classes. My sister faced the same situation at the same school so it can work, I just have been putting it off because this whole year has been stressful. I took a break from school to better myself but I just got a lot worse instead. Pretty ironic.

2020-03-08 13:35:27,I hate people who post life advise images constantly.,:thinking: Thoughts & Ideas,"I guess hate is a strong word here, more just annoyed. I'm talking about those images that have short little phrases or quotes like ""Someone who over thinks is someone who over loves."" Or ""if my mouth doesn't say it my face definitely will.""

I see this mostly on Facebook and Instagram. I know that this is probably my first problem, but I am stuck on these platforms due to work. I sometimes find myself scrolling and seeing people posting that kind of stuff on the daily. It just gives me this feeling of deep annoyance for some reason. I understand that people like using their accounts as personal blogs or collections of things they enjoy, but what is the point of finding these images and then posting them and never seeing it again. I guess I am being very cynical when I say that NO ONE CARES. There is a whole side of the world full of people who post these all the time. Wouldn't it be better if people saw these images and then came up with their own advice or an experience based around the image and posted it. At least that's putting in some effort!

Furthermore, why do all these accounts exist in the first place. Most of these pages devoted to these kinds of ""memes"" and pictures from which people share them, are just that, no about section, no human posts. Just soulless, robotic sections of the internet pumping out this content to no end. I wouldn't be surprised if they are just bots that continue to find images and post them.

I think my main problem is when I see people who post these things, I know that they are not practicing these values in their real life. It's a sort of weird window into their subconscious. Like if you compile all of these little personality traits, values, and feelings in one you will get the person they WANT to be. But maybe not the person they are currently. 

So overall I don't mind if people post this kind of stuff if they really want to and I understand people have the right to use their personal accounts for whatever they want. I beleive that people are stuck in this loop of sharing and posting this content and not making any meaningful change in their life or impact towards others. 

And finally, I think this leads to the bigger problem with social media and the internet today. Maybe I am being too harsh. Maybe I should just let people do what they do. But part of me is saying no this is not good, this is a pointless, stupid, low effort norm of culture today that far too many people participate in.

2020-06-13 11:35:29,My job is killing me but I can't afford to stop working.,,"I'm 25 and male. I have a Masters in engineering. Due to bad luck and shit job market, I work in retail. I earn just over minimum wage and have no work-life balance. I spend 9 hours a day being treated like an absolute subhuman by everybody I encounter. I have no hope for the future and I am on tracks to an early grave.

My job makes me depressed. I hate most of the people I work with. They're petty, odious, stupid little creatures. My wage is terrible and I live in a bad area surrounded by bad people. I don't feel intellectually or existentially fulfilled and I am not even close to realising my full potential. I feel like I have so much to offer but nobody is interested in what I have. I can't pursue hobbies or interests because the emotional dissonance from work drains me psychologically and I spend my fragmented spare time lying on the floor staring at the wall or ceiling waiting for the day to end.

I can't afford to quit because I need to pay rent. During lockdown I began studying another degree in an attempt to break into another industry, so I must keep paying for that. Naturally, since returning to work, I feel very demoralised about this whole thing anyway.

I wish I had the courage to kill myself. I realised when I was 17 that I was never going to be happy but I never realised things were going to get this bad. I have no future. Do you know how hard it is to get out of bed, let alone force yourself to do something you hate for 6 days a week, when you have no hope for the future? You can endure misery if you think it's going to pay off one day. I've sacrificed so, so much already. So much time. So many opportunities. All in pursuit of education that got me nowhere.

I've started exhibiting some rather serious physical symptoms. I can't sleep. My anxiety is so bad I feel like I'm a gentle nudge away from a panic attack all of the time. I have such strong anxiety that I have constant chest, back and neck pains. I have heart palpitations on a daily basis. I feel like it's just a matter of time before I have a stroke or a heart attack.

I've thought about death and dying almost every day since late 2017. It's all I think about. I just want the lights to go out. I feel an overwhelming resentment to the rest of the world for the fate it has bestowed upon me. I feel anger and hate towards anybody who is ahead of me, especially if they're less industrious than I am. Resentment is a difficult emotion. It's even more difficult when it's justified. I feel like nothing matters other than luck, and I've been so unlucky so far that I can never recover. I've slipped through the cracks and I'm too far behind.",1592046696.0,2,0,0,0,0,depression

It's been a while since this started, like 5 years or something and things have changed, some things are gone but others appeared same with people. 

Its hard to believe for me that at some point i was ""ok"" i used to not worry about anything and the future was clear but it is not. 

I can't even thing I've fallen down so much, not what i used to be or what i thought i was but yeah i know something is not right, i can feel it inside me apart from my horrible body transformation, seriously I can't even concentrate about something, I can't even stop for 3 seconds and think. I don't even know if i can recover

I finished high school a couple weeks ago, now what? I feel so bad about that, feels like wasted time, 3 years of wasted time, didn't even got ready for what's next so what was the point of it? I used to have projects, kinda life projects you know, things that you would like to do, all of them have died. I really dont have a purpose or an objective.

I don't want to blame my parents for all this, me and only me are responsible for what happened or will happen in my life, no one else. But even then they never really helped me with anything, only paying the school but again, for what? All the things that i wanted to do they never helped me, they want to control my life and that sucks. I told them that i wanted to work and they won't let me its just so stupid 


So that's it, i just don't know what to do, i feel awful, I dont have nothing to do or to work on, every day is worse, i can't sleep

2020-06-14 15:01:54,Anxiety about going back to work,,"Hey guys, a little background here: I've been struggling with depression for going on 3 years now. It began the second half of my freshman year (I also worked constantly throughout college, around 30 hours per week) and continued until summer. That fall, it returned, leading to me almost attempting suicide. It subsided after I dropped some of my classes. That spring my depression came back, leading me to quit my job and drop calc 2 for a second time. That summer, I took summer classes and got a new job. That was not a good idea. The stress lead me back into a depression so bad that I attempted suicide, dropping out of college and losing my new job. 

After doing time inpatient, I was starting to feel better and, with pushing from my therapist, I got a job at Lowe's. When coronavirus hit, things went to hell. More and more people were calling off everyday, and sales were up 50%. Between that and all of the new procedures I had to remember (surprise surprise) my depression came back with a vengeance. I was having impulsive thoughts of driving into a telephone pole driving to and from work, I couldn't carry my box cutter because it made me want to self-harm. So I quit. Again.

Now, here I am. What little savings I had are dry. I have to go back to work or starve. I sent applications to the State Park Service where I thought I could handle the work, but I got rejected. I have gotten job offers from Chewy and other warehouses as well as call centers, none of which I applied to. I would rather kill myself now then go back to one of those jobs that treats me less than human. If I do that, I'll just become suicidal again anyway. I don't know what I'm even looking for here. Probably just to vent.

At first i’d like to show my gratitude and thank this community. It seems to be the best around.

I’m a 32 year old architecture student and have just been diagnosed with adhd in the past weeks. The entire test battery has not been entirely completed yet and my m.d. is certain already; even though he is meticulous to avoid any misdiagnosis.

My CBT smartly didn’t push the topic in our conversations and only ever dropped a hint here and there.

She let me find out myself through psycho-education and after I swiftly realised by reading valid source material and your cumulative experience how severe my case is, did I confront her with my reflections and sought out the mentioned specialist for who she gave me a letter, supporting my position.

It’s a massive paradigm shift in personal perception and self-reflection. Suddenly everything is explained. 
It’s mind-boggling and a little scary when I read what seems to be a general manual to my character and behaviour.

One of the best sources I’ve found is in german: [adhspedia.de](https://www.adhspedia.de) .
English is my second and I’m on mobile with my alt-account so I beg your pardon for any flaw you might find in this post. I’m not much of a writer.

I’ve agreed to let the medical university study the data of my insomnia in a sleep room, like most of you surely experienced as well, because they suspect a connection to the imbalance of dopamine concentrations/absorption between synapse. They hope to make a full-fledged medical study out of it.

After that I’ll be medicated and tested again. The doctor suggested it and confirmed my research on the success of medication which gave me relief and raised much hope.

It seems I’m lucky and I managed somehow, despite the hypoactive form of adhd.
He described that a lot of severe cases like mine (2nd highest afawk) fail school, become homeless (got very close to it twice) or get imprisoned.

Ironically I did a call in the army and was successful in responsibility and leading. Only I was deathly bored in the office and went to university.

I haven’t failed my studies yet (though I’m critically close due to time limitations and my age) and I’m self-employed as a sole source of income. Adhd is quite isolating and unfortunately I have no family backup.

Well, so I’ll hopefully be part of yours now.
I look forward to add value like you did in here.

All in all, life felt like defeat and unused potential.
I might get that potential back now.
